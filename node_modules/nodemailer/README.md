Nodemailer
==========

**Nodemailer** is an easy to use module to send e-mails with Node.JS (using SMTP or sendmail) and it's Unicode friendly - You can use any characters you like ✔

Nodemailer supports
-------------------

  - **Unicode** to use any characters
  - **HTML content** as well as **plain text** alternative
  - **Attachments**
  - **Embedded images** in HTML
  - **SSL/TLS** for secure e-mail delivery
  - **SMTP**, **sendmail** and **Amazon SES**

Installation
------------

Install through *NPM*

    npm install nodemailer

or download [ZIP archive](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/zipball/master).

The source for Nodemailer is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer).

### Compatibility

Nodemailer is fully compatible with Node.js versions 0.3.x, 0.4.x and 0.5.x on *nix and 0.5.x on Windows

Usage
-----

**nodemailer.send_mail(mail_params, callback)**

Where

  * **mail_params** defines the e-mail (set its subject, body text, receivers etc.), see *E-mail Message Fields* for details
  * **callback** is the callback function that will be run after the e-mail is sent or the sending failed

Simple use case to send a HTML e-mail with plaintext alternative

    var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

    // one time action to set up SMTP information
    nodemailer.SMTP = {
        host: 'smtp.example.com'
    }

    // send an e-mail
    nodemailer.send_mail(
        // e-mail options
        {
            sender: 'me@example.com',
            to:'you@example.com',
            subject:'Hello!',
            html: '<p><b>Hi,</b> how are you doing?</p>',
            body:'Hi, how are you doing?'
        },
        // callback function
        function(error, success){
            console.log('Message ' + success ? 'sent' : 'failed');
        }
    );

The callback function gets two parameters - *error* and *success*. If there's an 
error, then sending failed and you should check where's the problem. If there's 
no error value but *success* is not *true* then the server wasn't able to process 
the message correctly. Probably there was timeout while processing the message 
etc - in this case you should re-schedule sending this e-mail. If *success* 
is *true* then the message was sent successfully.

See [examples/example_smtp.js](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/blob/master/examples/example_smtp.js) for a complete example.

Transfer method setup
----------

Before sending any e-mails you need to set up a transfer method for delivering the messages.

To do this you need to define a properties object for a specific transfer method. Setup only one of these methods since only the first one defined will be used.

### SMTP

Use SMTP as the transfer method with the following setup

    nodemailer.SMTP = {
        host: 'smtp.example.com', // required
        port: 25, // optional, defaults to 25 or 465
        use_authentication: false, // optional, false by default
        user: '', // used only when use_authentication is true 
        pass: ''  // used only when use_authentication is true
    }

### Amazon SES

Use Amazon SES as the transfer method with the following setup

    nodemailer.SES = {
        AWSAccessKeyID: 'ACCESSKEY', // required
        AWSSecretKey: 'SECRETKEY', // required
        ServiceUrl: 'https://email.us-east-1.amazonaws.com', // optional
    }

### sendmail

Use `sendmail` as the transfer method with the following setup

    nodemailer.sendmail = true;

or

    nodemailer.sendmail = '/path/to/sendmail';

Aditional setup
----------------

### SSL Support with SMTP (port 465)

If you want to use SSL (not TLS/STARTTLS, just SSL), you need to set the *ssl* parameter to true.

	nodemailer.SMTP = {
	    host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
	    port: 465,
	    ssl: true,
	    use_authentication: true,
	    user: 'my.username@gmail.com',
	    pass: 'my.password'
	}

### TLS Support with SMTP (port 587)

If you want to use TLS/STARTTLS (port 587), leave *ssl* to false or do not set it, encryption will be started automatically when needed.

    nodemailer.SMTP = {
        host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
        port: 587,
        ssl: false,
        use_authentication: true,
        user: 'my.username@gmail.com',
        pass: 'my.password'
    }

E-mail Message Fields
--------------------

The following are the possible fields of an e-mail message:

  - **sender** - The e-mail address of the sender. All e-mail addresses can be plain `sender@server.com` or formatted `Sender Name <sender@server.com>`
  - **to** - Comma separated list of recipients e-mail addresses that will appear on the `To:` field
  - **cc** - Comma separated list of recipients e-mail addresses that will appear on the `Cc:` field
  - **bcc** - Comma separated list of recipients e-mail addresses that will appear on the `Bcc:` field
  - **reply_to** - An e-mail address that will appear on the `Reply-To:` field
  - **subject** - The subject of the e-mail
  - **body** - The plaintext version of the message
  - **html** - The HTML version of the message
  - **attachments** - An array of attachment objects. Attachment object consists of two properties - `filename` and `contents`. Property `contents` can either be a String or a Buffer (for binary data). `filename` is the name of the attachment.

There's an optional extra field **headers** which holds custom header values in the form of `{key: value}`. These values will not overwrite any existing header but will be appended to the list.

    mail_data = {
        sender:'me@example.com',
        to:'you@example.com',
        ....
        headers: {
            'X-My-Custom-Header-Value': 'Visit www.example.com for more info!'
        }
    }

For debugging set **debug** to true - then all the data passed between the client and the server will be output to console.

Address Formatting
------------------

All the e-mail addresses can be plain e-mail address

    username@example.com

or with formatted name (includes unicode support)

    'Ноде Майлер' <username@example.com>

To, Cc and Bcc fields accept comma separated list of e-mails. Formatting can be mixed.

    username@example.com, 'Ноде Майлер' <username@example.com>, "Name, User" <username@example.com>

Creating HTML messages
----------------------

Message body in HTML format can be set with the message field `html`. If property `html` has contents but plain text alternative `body` has not (is left to empty), then existing text from the html version is also used in the plaintext version (without the html formatting).

The charset for `html` is UTF-8.

    nodemailer.send_mail({
        ...
        html: '<p>hello world!<br/>хелло ворлд!</p>'
    });

Using Attachments
-----------------

An e-mail message can include one or several attachments. Attachments can be set with the message field `attachments` which accepts a list of attachment objects.

An attachment object primarly consists of two properties - `filename` which is the name of the file (not a filepath to an actual file on disk etc.) that will be reported to the receiver as the attachments name; and `contents` to hold the data in a String or Buffer format.
There's an additional property `cid`  which can be used for embedding images in a HTML message.

Property `filename` is unicode safe.

    var attachment_list = [
        {
            'filename': 'attachment1.txt',
            'contents': 'contents for attachment1.txt'
        },
        {
            'filename': 'аттачмент2.bin',
            'contents': new Buffer('binary contents', 'binary');
        }
    ];

    nodemailer.send_mail({
        ...
        attachments: attachment_list
    });

Using Embedded Images
---------------------

Attachments can be used as embedded images in the HTML body. To use this feature, you need to set additional property
of the attachment - `cid` (unique identifier of the file) which is a reference to the attachment file.
The same `cid` value must be used as the image URL in HTML (using `cid:` as the URL protocol, see example below).

**NB!** the cid value should be as unique as possible!

    var cid_value = Date.now() + '.image.jpg';
    var html = 'Embedded image: <img src="cid:' + cid_value + '" />';
    var attachments = [{
        filename: 'image.png',
        contents: IMAGE_CONTENTS,
        cid: cid_value
    }];

Issues
------

Use [Nodemailer Issue tracker](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer/issues) to report additional shortcomings, bugs, feature requests etc.

### Charsets

Currently the only allowed charset is UTF-8. This is probably not going to change.

### Slow

SMTP connections are not shared - if you want to send several e-mails to the same domain in a row, then for every mail a new connection is created and closed afterwards. Together with TLS negotiation this can turn out to be pretty slow. Nodemailer is not the best choice for spamming!

### Attachments

Do not use large attachments as the attachment contents are read into memory and the final message body is combined into one large string before sending.
