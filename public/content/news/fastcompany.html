<h3>Product Spam Is Out Of Control And Must Be Stopped</h3>

Environmentalism is no longer just a crunchy cause, but also a corporate mandate. Simple is good.</p><p>So why has product spam spun out of control? Perhaps HP (and others) didn't get the memo? Whatever the reason, one thing is now painfully clear: Product spam must stop.</p><p><strong>Spam Attack!</strong></p><p>As exhibit A, check out Hewlett Packard's new computers released yesterday. In fact, it's practically impossible not to check them out: HP has coughed up a number of machines at the same time, and they're filling the homepages of many a gadget site. There's the Envy 15, the Envy 17, the Envy 17-3D for starters--all aluminum-bodied, chiclet-keyboarded units with a variety of internal specs and screen technologies. They're otherwise very similar to each other, and don't depart too far from the designs and specs HP has used in previous models. There's also the new Folio 13 Ultrabook, aimed at the burgeoning ultra-light/heavy-on-performance laptop market. And the newly made-over Pavilion DM4, with refreshed audio internals alongside a nearly identical but "special" Beats edition. These machines join a stable of dozens of other HP machines on sale--the company's website even carefully defines them for you as its Mini, Everyday Computing, Ultra-Portable, High-Performance, and Envy ranges.&nbsp;</p><p>Great, you may think: A machine to suit nearly everyone's needs, and everyone's pockets. But HP isn't the only computer maker doing this. A scan through Sony's laptop offerings, Acer's, Dell's and so on turns up the same behavior. Everyone offers a huge array of machines, each with slightly different internal specifications and vastly different prices.</p><p>And it's not just laptops. How about Klipsch's new Lou Reed signature headphones? Apart from the slight redesign, the branded edition is almost identical to an existing Klipsch set. But let's not pick on Klipsch, as there's much more exciting fare to be offered by Sony: Its headphones page for the USA store lists seven different headphones designs for the "iPod/iPhone remote control" category alone.</p><p><strong>What The Spec?</strong></p><p>RIM just revealed its new BlackBerry Bold 9790 and Curve 9380 machines. The Bold has a 2.44-inch touchscreen, 1GHz processor, 8GB of storage, QWERTY keyboard, and an almost identical look and feel to the dozens of similar BlackBerrys that have preceded it. The Curve 9380 has a 3.2-inch touchscreen, no keyboard, NFC support, and a 5-megapixel camera--the "first-ever BlackBerry(R) Curve(TM) smartphone with a touch display," the press release calls it. But turn the Curve off, and slot it on a shelf on a phone store next to the Android machines from HTC, Huawei, Samsung, Sony...and you'll barely be able to single it out at a couple of paces distance.</p><p>Even Samsung, which is keeping things fairly consistent with its Galaxy lineup of phones and tablets (and is embroiled in a legal battle with Apple, which accuses it of cloning everything about the design right down to the boxes and promo materials), feels the need to sell a 10-inch Galaxy Tab alongside a 7-inch unit and a 9-inch unit.</p><p>Smartphones are a particularly interesting case to look at, especially if you at the work of companies like iSuppli. These firms hit the headlines with their informed teardowns of new hardware, and their smart backwards-engineering thinking to try to work out how much it costs to make these machines--thanks to their expertise in sourcing components. That's where we get the bill of materials comparisons between phones from, and while gizmo geeks may love poring over the details, the casual observer will note that the difference in component prices between, for example, most top-level smartphones is measured in tens of dollars--not hundreds. A five-megapixel camera unit for one smartphone versus an eight-megapixel one for another costs only a couple of dollars difference nowadays, thanks to ubiquitous supply among competing Asian manufacturers, and yet consumers are charged a huge multiple of this difference in the end price.</p><p><strong>The Shotgun Effect</strong></p><p>All this is fuel for a skeptic to ponder if product spamming is a mask for charging consumers a spectrum of prices for superficially different products.</p><p>There are reasons for making multiple products, of course. There's the shotgun effect, for one: If you can shoot multiple products at a market at the same time, you may find enough of them hitting their mark, pleasing the public and selling well--but you have to shoot enough at the same time to cover losses from the poor sellers with the good sellers. It's also a move that also limits the amount of money and effort you spend in differentiating your products: Hence, spam. This approach is different to taking aim at the market with a specific, carefully crafted shot--a single product, which requires confidence you've got your aim right.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also argue that the public has been trained to expect a diverse choice--consumerism has run rampant since Henry Ford offered just one edition of the Model T car, and by offering multiple similar products firms like Sony and HP can create an illusion of choice in the shopper's mind.</p><p>From a production point of view, putting out numerous similar products also creates economies of scale with suppliers of component parts, efficiencies in design, simplicity in creating packaging, and so on. Rich Leigh of the 10 Yetis PR agency and the writer behind the Good And Bad PR blog, gets to see much of the efforts companies put into promoting their diverse product lines. "Whereas some market-leading manufacturers are confident in developing a few
products per division, innovating and releasing new iterations to keep
customers buying," Leigh says, "certain manufacturers seem to rely on this
product-spamming." From a PR point of view, Leigh thinks "although these releases may have slight
differences that serve different niches, it appears desperate or cowardly,
almost like the manufacturers are afraid to develop one or two products and
fully back themselves."</p><p><strong>Waste not...</strong></p><p>One other downside to product spam could be high product turnover.</p><p>To put things in context: In 2009, it was estimated that 53 million tons of electronic waste was generated globally as people threw away products (the figure would be higher if you included waste material generated at manufacturing), and only 13% of it was recycled.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007 it was estimated 426,000 cell phones were decomissioned every single day in the U.S., many of course being tossed in the trash rather than being recycled--the statistic prompted an artist to create this image of what that pile would look like (each spec in the left hand part of the image is a phone--zoomed in on the right):"  <img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/cellphonewaste.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p>In 2010, as a measure of how much worse this problem has got in a short interval, it's&nbsp;thought&nbsp;the U.S.&nbsp;alonegenerated 3 million tons of e-waste, and China produced 2.3 million tons--with estimates that China will rapidly produce much more waste as its population embraces consumer purchasing more and more. By 2020, the&nbsp;UN estimates&nbsp;that e-waste in South Africa and China from old PCs will be at 400% of its 2007 levels, and 500% in India. In terms of cell phones, the figure is 700% for China, and 1800% in India. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>...Want not</strong></p><p>But as well as e-waste, consider the intellectual waste of tech product spam. How often have you trawled the shelves of your local electronics store, comparing specs, price, look and feel of a new purchase? Did it ultimately perform remarkably differently to how a very similar--but different--product would have? If you remember Watership Down, the classic young adult novel and movie, you'll recall the rabbits in the story have a behavior called "going tharn." It's when they're confronted by dazzling headlights, and can't make a decision on what to do: This sensation has been applied to the act of shopping for the dazzling array of consumer goods by Shari Swan, CEO of Streative Branding--and we've all felt it. </p><p>Leigh commented that all product spam does "is confuse your average consumer who doesn't particularly want to spend days researching each purchase, forcing them to buy a simpler, more off-the-shelf alternative. In any industry, the scatter-gun approach rarely works."&nbsp;Graham Hill, founder of Treehugger, took it one stage further, and alluded to the complexities of owning too much stuff (including gadgets) in a recent Ted Talk, suggesting "less stuff, more happiness."</p><p>[youtube L8YJtvHGeUU]</p><p><strong>The Future Is Unwritten</strong></p><p>It's time for manufacturers to stop spamming us with a bewildering array of hugely similar products, sometimes with a dazzling array of names (DROID Eris, DROID Incredible, Curve, Bold, London, Zeta...or equally the MDRAS50-G, Series 7 Chronos 15.6, NP-RF711-S03&nbsp;and far worse examples). </p><p>We're not suggesting centuries of commercial practice be upended, as this makes no sense. It's that more honesty in design and function should perhaps drive product ranges. One upshot of this happening could be that consumers could feel free to buy less, take better care of what we have, throw less away, and suffer less emotional pressure when shopping. </p><p>And finally, less spam would mean more time for all those talented folks in the R&amp;D and design teams at major manufacturers to concentrate on innovating new ways for new products to actually improve our lives in meangingful ways.</p><p>[Image: Tumblr ThingsOrganizedNeatly]</p>

<h3>LinkedIn Cofounder Reid Hoffman In The U.K.: Silicon Valley Can Be Exported</h3>

<p></p><p></p><p><img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/ReidHoffman275.jpg-thumb.jpg" />For the fourth year in a row, LinkedIn cofounder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman is co-leading "Silicon Valley Comes To The UK"&nbsp;(SVC2UK), a four-year-old program to inspire and foster high-tech entrepreneurship in Britain. Over the course of four days, about 30 Silicon Valley executives, founders, and investors are meeting with students, entrepreneurs, and British policymakers to share what they know and catalyze the kinds of networks that will lead to more high-growth startups in the U.K. and Europe.</p><p>Hoffman sat down with Fast Company to talk about why he carves time out of his packed schedule to try to build up a tech scene 5,000 miles away from home. </p><p>(Tomorrow: Hoffman talks big data, his upcoming book,&nbsp;The Start-Up of You, and why hes only checked LinkedIns stock price a few times since the company went public in May.)</p><p><strong>Fast Company: Youre a busy man. Why spend time on something like SVC2UK?</strong></p><p><strong>Reid Hoffman: </strong>We believe in spreading high-impact entrepreneurship and increasing the abilities for people anywhere in the world to start high-growth companies. There's a fair amount of entrepreneurial spirit in Oxford, Cambridge, and London. We want to teach students about high-impact entrepreneurship and what's possible with technology, to connect them with local entrepreneurs, CEOs, and founders, and to connect them with local investors.</p><p><strong>Is there something about tech entrepreneurship in the U.K. that youre particularly excited about?</strong></p><p>Any place that has a good depth of technical universities and skills, and even a partial entrepreneurial culture, I tend to be very supportive of philosophically. Whats unique here is the U.K. is perhaps the central place where, if you were thinking about a capital of entrepreneurship that could go all across Europe, youd basically come to London, Cambridge, and Oxford.</p><p><strong>What needs to change here for startup culture to really take off?</strong></p><p>There are a lot of things governments can do to facilitate effective high-impact entrepreneurship. They have this "Entrepreneur Visa"&nbsp;that lets entrepreneurs to come here to build companies. But they need to expand that to be generally intelligent on immigration. It's not just the founders [who need to get in], you need a broad pool of capable talent.</p><p>Governments should think a lot about how they foster platforms, marketplaces, and networks, like how they can help entrepreneurs to connect with each other. And there are things they can do in procurement. One of the things startups need are customers. We can help them out by making government an early easy customer.</p><p>And then there are things they can do on labor laws. One of the reasons Silicon Valley has flourished is "at will" employment for small companies and a lack of enforcement on anti-compete clauses. Anti-compete clauses are generally the way big companies can beat up small companies.</p><p><strong>Are there any startups or incubators in the U.K. that you're particularly excited about?</strong></p><p>Saul Klein is doing interesting things with Seedcamp, which goes across Europe. We at Greylock Partners have made a Discovery Fund investment in a startup here called ArtFinder, partially because we think the category of art is interesting and partially because Spencer Hyman, the CEO and founder [and former COO of Last.fm, which Hoffman invested in], is somebody we know.</p><p>And Greylock IL ["Greylock Israel"] has made some investments in some U.K. companies, like Wonga--they do micro-loans.</p><p><strong>Some people say you just can't export Silicon Valley. Are they wrong?</strong></p><p>You could probably do a Silicon Valley in Europe.  The attributes of Silicon Valley can be rebuilt and learned in other places. In Silicon Valley, you have a dense network, and people share information about what techniques are working, what new technologies are coming, what new prospects might be, what ways of solving problems of customer growth should be--all sorts of things.</p><p>Those kinds of things are buildable in other places. They won't necessarily be exactly like Silicon Valley. Maybe Silicon Valley will be the primary consumer Internet hub of the world. But there's room for clean tech and other industries.</p><p><strong>The entrepreneurs you work with in the U.K. learn a lot from you. What do you get out of interacting with them?</strong></p><p>For me, it's simply a delight to be solving new problems with young, motivated, highly talented people trying to change the world.</p><p>You also maintain your own youth and agility of mindset by talking to people with new ideas, new mindsets, who are pushing on boundaries, who are not taking conventional wisdom as truth, but seeking to do something new and different.</p><p>Image: Greylock Partners</p><p>E.B.

We at Greylock Partners have made a Discovery Fund investment in a startup here called ArtFinder, partially because we think the category of art is interesting and partially because Spencer Hyman, the CEO and founder [and former COO of Last.fm, which Hoffman invested in], is somebody we know.And Greylock IL ['Greylock Israel'] has made some investments in some U.K. companies, like Wonga--they do micro-loans.Some people say you just can't export Silicon Valley. Are they wrong?You could probably do a Silicon Valley in Europe.  The attributes of Silicon Valley can be rebuilt and learned in other places. In Silicon Valley, you have a dense network, and people share information about what techniques are working, what new technologies are coming, what new prospects might be, what ways of solving problems of customer growth should be--all sorts of things.Those kinds of things are buildable in other places. They won't necessarily be exactly like Silicon Valley. Maybe Silicon Valley will be the primary consumer Internet hub of the world. But there's room for clean tech and other industries.The entrepreneurs you work with in the U.K. learn a lot from you. What do you get out of interacting with them?For me, it's simply a delight to be solving new problems with young, motivated, highly talented people trying to change the world.You also maintain your own youth and agility of mindset by talking to people with new ideas, new mindsets, who are pushing on boundaries, who are not taking conventional wisdom as truth, but seeking to do something new and different.Image: Greylock PartnersE.B.

<h3>9 Nagging Questions To Tune Out When Launching A Startup</h3>
<p class="news-date">Thu, 17 Nov 2011 14:52:14 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Christy Liu</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p></p><p></p><p><img alt="" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/startup-cliches-300.jpg-thumb.jpg" />So, youve decided to do the startup thing, and youve told a few people. Turns out everyone and their dog has an opinion about it, regardless of whether or not theyve ever been in your shoes. Some are flat-out discouraging you, while others are congratulating you and asking some interesting questions you havent yet considered.</p><p>Youre quickly discovering that many people are coming along with you for the startup ride: your friends, family, business partners, investors, cofounders, employees, and more. And theyve all got something to say.</p><p>Who should you listen to? How much of what theyre saying is true? What does it all mean?</p><p>Three years after starting my first company and two years into my current startup, Wanderfly, Im still trying to make sense of everything, but there are 10 questions and statements that just seem to come up over and over again. Let me provide a bit of a reality check and decipher what it all actually means to you.</p><p><strong>Your MBA friend will say: "I hope youve written a serious business plan. You HAVE done that, right?"</strong></p><p>Actually: Its a delicate balance here. On one hand, your b-school friend is right in that not every idea is gold; what YOU think is a problem that needs fixing might not actually be a problem for the vast majority of people. Or, a gazillion startups have already done what you want to do and youre about half a decade too late (oh, you havent heard about this company called Facebook?). Or, your amazing concept is going to require a budget only Bruce Wayne could finance and, to boot, its not going to make back any money in your lifetime.</p><p>Whoops. If only you had taken the time to do a proper SWOT and financial model.</p><p>Conversely, one of our investors, Jason Calacanis, is famously against business plans. Hes got a point. Thinking about it means not doing it. Words cant compare to a real product. No amount of analysis will prepare you for the real world. And your brilliant idea will change three times. At least. So, why are you wasting your time predicting the unpredictable?!</p><p>My advice: Do something in the middle. Talk to everyone you know and make them grill you until you have answers for every major section a business plan covers--product, market, distribution, competition, revenue, etc. But dont spend an extra second making it pretty and fussing over whether it should be written "We" or "The Company." Write it in bullets if you want. If your idea still looks good in that format, get moving: The quicker you execute on it, the better.</p><p>Youre probably wondering what we did for Wanderfly. On a whim, we entered a business plan competition and wrote a beautiful novel that took a week of three peoples time. About half of it is relevant today. Looking back, we could have spent most of those 200 hours discussing instead of writing.</p><p><strong>Your parents will say: "If youre itching for a change, have you considered grad school?"</strong></p><p>Actually: Okay, this is a sticky one that not everyone will appreciate, but here goes: You will learn more in a startup than you will ever learn in a classroom. Youll learn through doing, through figuring out something by yourself because nobody is there to hold your hand and through being the companys salesperson, programmer, designer, accountant, and lawyer--all at once. Even if it ultimately doesnt work out, youll come away with an experience unlike any other and more skills in your back pocket than your fellow grad student (and, if you do decide to go back to a corporate job, you may find out that youre more marketable than ever).</p><p>Some caveats. Go to grad school if youre switching careers entirely and need the fundamentals. Go to grad school if you just love to learn in a structured environment. Go to grad school if you mean medical school. Please.</p><p>Dont go just because you dont know what else to do. There are other ways to find out, without the $100,000 price tag.</p><p><strong>Your ex-colleague will say: "Youre so lucky to be your own boss!"</strong></p><p>Actually: Its not all its cracked up to be. You often feel stressed. Tired. Insecure. Disappointed. Anxious. Panicked. Confused. The lows are as violent as the highs and if something fails, who else do you have to blame? Responsibility is a double-edged sword.</p><p>Whats more, all the high-level whiteboard strategery you did in your fancy Aeron chair at your last corporate job hardly applies now. You will be doing junior-level work. You will be mopping your office floor. You will be working longer hours. You will feel bad for taking vacation (and so you might not take it even if you started a travel company, ahem).</p><p>But maybe thats partly why you do it--because there are no rules or glass ceiling. Nobody there to tell you what you can or cant do, and nobody there to take the credit when you do make it.</p><p><strong>Your engineer friend will say: "Marketing is a crock. If you build it, they will come."</strong></p><p>Actually: Well, no. They may not come because they have nowhere to find you. Think about it: There are 40,000 products in the typical supermarket; 150,000 new URLs are registered each day. Whether youre launching a new granola bar or a website, there are hundreds, if not thousands of similar companies all up in your space. Your new company--NO MATTER how awesome it is--starts out as a needle in the haystack.</p><p>Its up to you to help people find you. Marketing is not all subliminal messaging or selling newborns candy and ciggies. Marketing is market-ing: bringing your product to market. You market yourself when you tell someone about your company; when you strike up a distribution partnership with another company; when you invite beta testers to try your product; when you email people to announce news; when you give people incentives to tell other people about you.</p><p>Great companies have marketing intentionally built into the DNA of their products. YouTubes video sharing, Groupons group buying, Methods stunning packaging, Dropboxs shared folders, Kickstarters crowd-funding. Maybe you didnt realize it, but just by using them youre part of their marketing team. Clever.</p><p><strong>Your wantrepreneur friend will say: "Reporters and venture capitalists are sacred. Its a real privilege to get their ear, so make sure it counts if youre so lucky to get the opportunity."</strong></p><p>Actually: Its not a privilege, provided you have a good story (which of course you do!). Its much more of a two-way street: You need them and they need you. Reporters need new stories to write, or else theyre regurgitating the same boring stuff. Investors need companies to fund, or else theyre just sitting on cash.</p><p>A couple months before we launched Wanderfly, some PR folks advised me to dress in my finest and prepare a gift bag for my meeting with Well Known Writer from Well Known Magazine. Nervous as hell with branded mugs and T-shirts in hand, I arrived on the 40th floor only to find her sitting in a small cubicle strewn with papers and empty cups of coffee because she was cramming for a deadline. It dawned on me: Well Known Writer was just a normal person. We had a normal conversation. I didnt even leave behind the gift bag.</p><p>Same goes for investors. The ones who act like theyre doing you a favor by gracing you with their holier-than-thou presence are not doing you a favor at all; theyre wasting your time.</p><p><strong>Your prospective investor will say: "Another startup is already doing something like that. And what about [insert Fortune 500 company here], who launched your entire idea as just a small, little feature within their much larger site last year?"</strong></p><p>Actually: Being first-to-market RARELY matters. Facebook crushed Friendster. Apple copied Xeroxs graphical interface. Remember Lycos? Oh yeah, Google launched years after them.</p><p>In my industry (online travel) alone, you might know Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Priceline, CheapTickets, Hotwire...the list of seemingly similar companies goes on and on. Who knows who was first-to-market, but moreover, who cares? They all seem to do just fine.</p><p>Instead, one thing really matters: the market opportunity and your execution against it. Is there a problem that remains largely unsolved, despite all the incumbent players? How well does your solution work? Is the user experience more seamless than others out there? Is it more enjoyable to use? (And, of course, will someone somewhere in the mix pay for your solution?)</p><p>When we came up with the idea for Wanderfly, many told us one-of-the-aforementioned-large-companies would eat our lunch because they already had a similar travel inspiration tool as a tab on their site. We still went ahead because we knew we could design something that would simply be better and we could innovate light years faster. Now, we are rarely compared to this giant, and when we are, its because someone is saying were doing a better job. Our execution is so different that it, in and of itself, is reason enough for people to turn to us.</p><p><strong>Your prospective partner will say: "This sounds interesting, but were a bit slammed right now with our annual planning cycle. Maybe we should reconnect in six months."</strong></p><p>Actually: Kind of like dating, "maybe" usually means "no." Hate to say it, but someone--whether a potential partner, investor, or hire--who doesnt want to move forward quickly probably isnt going to move forward period. Or at least not in the compressed amount of time you have as a startup.</p><p>Not much more to say except, move on to the next.</p><p><strong>You and your cofounders pre-launch will say: "Google will TOTALLY buy us this time next year."</strong></p><p>Actually: Acquired in one year? Pshaw. Maybe youre dreaming of a scenario like AOL buying About.me four days after it launched. Continue dreaming. Truth is, youre not them and you probably wont be able to pull that off.</p><p>Even if Google calls you up in your first year, its likely more to say hi and start getting to know you. Its not to hand over a giant Publishers Clearing House check on first meeting.</p><p>Value takes time to develop. If you create your startup with the intention to sell it off immediately, itll probably show. Its not attractive to your customers and not to some potential acquirers either, who are really looking for a sustainable business with a strong team behind it. So, build the most valuable business you can--a business that scales with your customers wants.</p><p><strong>You and your cofounders post-launch will say: "CRAP. Look at what theyre doing! Look at how fast theyre moving! Look at their amazing press!"</strong></p><p>Actually: This one is true. You will find yourself saying/thinking this a lot. Its mostly unhealthy and you might want to keep it in check while you can.</p><p>Good artists copy; great artists steal, said Picasso. Or was it T.S. Eliot? Or Steve Jobs? Either way, you can only do this if you keep your finger on the competitive pulse. As a result, you might develop some Entrepreneur Envy in the process. A small dose of EE is good. A large dose of EE is self-destructive and will pull you and your teammates down, setting you all up for a fun bi-weekly emotional breakdown. </p><p>"They" will always be up to something. As will you. And you know what? They, too, are flipping out about all the new and shiny things youre doing and they too are having a self-doubt mini crisis reading about all the accolades you carefully fed to the press. Worry too much about what everyone else is doing and you've now wasted time on what you are going to do to make it better. Refer to my earlier points. (Why hello, Competitor X reading this article. Check me out on Fast Company!)</p><p><strong>Your impatience will say: "Lets hire that rockstar coder. I heard hes an ass, but we need to get the job done."</strong></p><p>Actually: Nothing matters more than the people you work with. Please refer to this piece by one of my partners in crime.</p><p>There you have it. Whether this has been frightening or comforting for you, I have no idea, but I hope it prepares you for what to expect. Now, if youve learned anything at all from this piece, stop reading and get on with your idea.</p><p>Author Christy Liu is the cofounder and director of marketing at Wanderfly.</p><p>For more leadership coverage, follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><p>[Image: Flickr user Tayrawr Fortune]</p>

The ones who act like theyre doing you a favor by gracing you with their holier-than-thou presence are not doing you a favor at all; theyre wasting your time.Your prospective investor will say: 'Another startup is already doing something like that. And what about [insert Fortune 500 company here], who launched your entire idea as just a small, little feature within their much larger site last year?'Actually: Being first-to-market RARELY matters. Facebook crushed Friendster. Apple copied Xeroxs graphical interface. Remember Lycos? Oh yeah, Google launched years after them.In my industry (online travel) alone, you might know Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Priceline, CheapTickets, Hotwire...the list of seemingly similar companies goes on and on. Who knows who was first-to-market, but moreover, who cares? They all seem to do just fine.Instead, one thing really matters: the market opportunity and your execution against it. Is there a problem that remains largely unsolved, despite all the incumbent players? How well does your solution work? Is the user experience more seamless than others out there? Is it more enjoyable to use? (And, of course, will someone somewhere in the mix pay for your solution?)When we came up with the idea for Wanderfly, many told us one-of-the-aforementioned-large-companies would eat our lunch because they already had a similar travel inspiration tool as a tab on their site. We still went ahead because we knew we could design something that would simply be better and we could innovate light years faster. Now, we are rarely compared to this giant, and when we are, its because someone is saying were doing a better job. Our execution is so different that it, in and of itself, is reason enough for people to turn to us.Your prospective partner will say: 'This sounds interesting, but were a bit slammed right now with our annual planning cycle. Maybe we should reconnect in six months.'Actually: Kind of like dating, 'maybe' usually means 'no.' Hate to say it, but someone--whether a potential partner, investor, or hire--who doesnt want to move forward quickly probably isnt going to move forward period. Or at least not in the compressed amount of time you have as a startup.Not much more to say except, move on to the next.You and your cofounders pre-launch will say: 'Google will TOTALLY buy us this time next year.'Actually: Acquired in one year? Pshaw. Maybe youre dreaming of a scenario like AOL buying About.me four days after it launched. Continue dreaming. Truth is, youre not them and you probably wont be able to pull that off.Even if Google calls you up in your first year, its likely more to say hi and start getting to know you. Its not to hand over a giant Publishers Clearing House check on first meeting.Value takes time to develop. If you create your startup with the intention to sell it off immediately, itll probably show. Its not attractive to your customers and not to some potential acquirers either, who are really looking for a sustainable business with a strong team behind it. So, build the most valuable business you can--a business that scales with your customers wants.You and your cofounders post-launch will say: 'CRAP. Look at what theyre doing! Look at how fast theyre moving! Look at their amazing press!'Actually: This one is true. You will find yourself saying/thinking this a lot. Its mostly unhealthy and you might want to keep it in check while you can.Good artists copy; great artists steal, said Picasso. Or was it T.S. Eliot? Or Steve Jobs? Either way, you can only do this if you keep your finger on the competitive pulse. As a result, you might develop some Entrepreneur Envy in the process. A small dose of EE is good. A large dose of EE is self-destructive and will pull you and your teammates down, setting you all up for a fun bi-weekly emotional breakdown. 'They' will always be up to something. As will you. And you know what? They, too, are flipping out about all the new and shiny things youre doing and they too are having a self-doubt mini crisis reading about all the accolades you carefully fed to the press. Worry too much about what everyone else is doing and you've now wasted time on what you are going to do to make it better. Refer to my earlier points. (Why hello, Competitor X reading this article. Check me out on Fast Company!)Your impatience will say: 'Lets hire that rockstar coder. I heard hes an ass, but we need to get the job done.'Actually: Nothing matters more than the people you work with. Please refer to this piece by one of my partners in crime.There you have it. Whether this has been frightening or comforting for you, I have no idea, but I hope it prepares you for what to expect. Now, if youve learned anything at all from this piece, stop reading and get on with your idea.Author Christy Liu is the cofounder and director of marketing at Wanderfly.For more leadership coverage, follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn.[Image: Flickr user Tayrawr Fortune]%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A  %0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/fastcompany/headlines/~3/XARuuo9h9GE/9-nagging-questions-to-tune-out-when-launching-a-startup%0A%0AThe L Train Notwork is brought to you by http://WeMakeCoolSh.it">Email this to myself</a></p></div><br /><br /><div>

<h3>Amazon's Kindle Fire: A Mega, Meta Mash-Up Of Reviews</h3>
<p class="news-date">Thu, 17 Nov 2011 12:30:48 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Adam Penenberg</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p>You could wade through dozens of reviews of the new Amazon Kindle Fire--or let us extract the best bits for you. Here's the most meta version of the story you will read online, offline, and everywhere else, each line taken from professional reviewers, tech bloggers, Tweeters, and Amazon customers.</p><p></p><p><img alt="fire poi expo" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/3476940249_bed4dd20e3_z.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p>
</p><p>It seems like ages since Amazon introduced us to the $199 Fire at a hectic New York City event, but in truth that was only about six weeks ago. Amazon's new wunderkind, panacea, and lynchpin of its continuing distribution domination began shipping on Monday, a day earlier than projected. What Amazon has delivered is a device that is intimately familiar yet mysterious--a simple, minimalistic exterior design hiding a flashy, seemingly quite trick customization that's sitting atop a decidedly ho-hum Android Gingerbread build. It's often said that there isn't really a tablet market, just an Apple iPad market with a bunch of other contenders fighting over the remnants. Has Amazon actually produced a tablet that can loosen Apple's iron grip on the market? </p>
<p>Make no mistake about it--the Fire is a proper tablet, with many (though not all) of the capabilities of something like an iPad. To actually win the hearts of consumers, to steal those throbbing, Cupertino-captivated organs away from the iPad, the Kindle Fire has to be amazing ...  and it isn't. The Fire isn't a dud, but its real-world performance and utility match neither the benchmarks of public expectation, nor the standards set by the world's best tablets. It has hit a stumbling block: the reviews so far are tepid. (Then again, the tone of the professional reviews reminds me a bit of reviews of the original 2007 Kindle.)</p>
<p> Animations are sluggish and jerky--even the page turns that you'd think would be the pride of the Kindle team. We expected more from the Kindle Fire's Silk browser. Sometimes the browser doesn't react to touch gestures at all, requiring that oh-so-annoying second tap or swipe instead. The momentum of the animations hasn't been calculated right, so the whole thing feels ornery. The magazine experience on the Kindle Fire isn't just bad, its possibly the worst magazine experience I have ever had. A 7-inch screen might be great for books, but how could anyone think it would work for what we think of as magazines? Try to find a 7-inch magazine on the (non-virtual) newsstand. The device is still better than most of Android tablets out there in the market, and the $199 price tag can't be beaten so easily--yet, it is far, far behind iPad, even the original iPad. You feel that $200 price tag with every swipe of your finger. Chalk this one up in the "you get what you pay for" column.</p>
<p>If you're an Amazon addict, the Kindle Fire's flaws may seem like less of a deal breaker. The reading experience is usually as fluid as the latest crop of e-ink-based Kindle devices, but things hum along a little faster thanks to that processor. Perfect Size &amp; Price Point. Slick &amp; Simple UI. The similarity to the BlackBerry PlayBook in terms of the design is undeniable, which is no wonder, as it has been designed by the same company. Amazon is the only major tablet maker other than Apple with a large, famous, easy-to-use content ecosystem that sells music, video, books and periodicals. The Fire can be thought of as a hardware front end to all that cloud content. Pretty awesome that the Kindle Fire still has access to all of Amazon's "Free Apps of The Day" that I download on my Droid X. </p>
<p>The Fire, the top-of-the-line Kindle tablet, has reportedly given some potential iPad purchasers second thoughts as the Fire is some $300 cheaper than the least-expensive iPad. From the moment you turn it on to the first time you download music from your own personal cloud to the minute you start watching a movie on the device and then continue watching on your HDTV--without connecting the device to the TV--you're hooked. Remember when you used to read books that were made out of protons and neutrons in addition to just electrons? Most of those weighed more than the Fire. And battery life was excellent.</p>
<p>Kindle Fire reviews run hot and cold from those who pre-ordered it, too. "I want to love it, I really do. But I can't, wrote one Amazon customer. "I like the size of it, and the display is clear, but it's not e-ink, so it's definitely not going to be a primary e-reader--the sounds are lame, and the tactile ergonomics are erratic and unreliable, which is just not OK," wrote another. Others complained that the Fire "IS REALLY BUGGY. I couldn't get through 3 chapters this morning without the device force-closing at least a dozen times" and disliked "having to press icons or buttons multiple times to get the device to do something." One guy said "it disappointed me more than I would have imagined." Nevertheless, 5-star reviews outpace 1-star reviews five-to-one. "This is a stunning personal media consumption device," boasted one Fire fanboy. Others said, "The Fire is svelte, sharp, crystaline, beautiful," "gorgeous, it's sharp, and it's tied automatically to your Amazon account." "It's exactly what I wanted and by that I mean it's great for surfing the Internet, checking email, reading books, magazines, and comics, and playing the occasional game." "Amazon could have charged a lot more for this INCREDIBLE piece of technology." Summed up one satisfied customer: "It is not an iPad. But neither is my coffee maker."</p>

<h3>Startup Vimessa Would Like You To Enjoy Video Messaging, Already</h3>
<p class="news-date">Thu, 17 Nov 2011 10:51:50 EST</p>

<div class="news-summary">
<p></p><p></p><p><img alt="vimessa" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/vimessa1.jpg-thumb.jpg" />Vimessa, "unlike iMessage, FaceTime, MMS and other video message services," works on "any mobile device and computer, including feature phones, smartphones and tablets" says the company. Short of the TV, that's pretty much every communications device we all regularly use--and Vimessa's careful to compare itself to the novel messaging tech being promoted by Apple in its recent devices (systems already championed for challenging the status quo). The firm is bargaining on a few big things: That many people will prefer to send a more personal video message than a text-based one, and the ability to send short video messages will draw more customers. </p><p>Video telephony has been around for decades, but has only become possible for the average consumer in serious numbers inside the last five or so years--as 3G cell phones became popular in Europe and Asia, mainly, and thanks to innovations like Skype's video calling mode (the U.S. has seemingly lagged in the tech, which may explain why there was so much excitement and hype when Apple launched its FaceTime app to bring simple video calling to iPhones). But despite the ready tech, the phenomenon hasn't taken off in the way early sci-fi predicted it would. As the Guardian argued back in 2007, despite the tech, the "cost and culture are putting people off talking face-to-face on the phone," and though Deloitte's early 2011 study predicted video calling will be "cheaper, better and more widely available than ever," it's not going to see "a boom in demand." </p><p>Deloitte reported a 115% culmulative growth of video calling in the U.S., driven by 400 million new devices with the right cameras going on sale this year--but the fact that a 115% growth rate isn't a "boom" tells you how few people are now regularly engaging in video chats.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's where Vimessa enters the scene. Peter Clark, CEO and cofounder, says that his research confirms "consumers want video mesaging, but they don't want it in the form-factor of a phone call--they want it in the form-factor of a text message. This makes a lot of sense if you look at all of the trends recently: everything is going asynchronos, so you can consume it later. Even IM is being replaced by Facebook messages." His team then "puzzled over why this idea hadn't been done before, and the reason is front-facing cameras [on phones] didn't really exist, so you were either tethered to a computer or you couldn't do it. It's only with the iPhone 4 and the Nexus S and also Windows phones with front-facing cameras that this is possible."</p><p>Vimessa works to let you send a video clip message to any phone number or email address, and it's the first app to let you do this, Clark asserts. You don't have to have the app installed to receive them--it works by routing around all the technological mismatches between phone and computer systems and even between phone formats, simply sending the recipient an SMS containing a URL to the video link. The link opens the phone's browser, and the web page optimized for the mobile browser then is the front-end for the video. The same system also works to and from a desktop computer, because, as Clark notes "we viewed it as that we should just 'remove the wiring'. The beauty of SMS is that is sends to every mobile device, as everyone has a phone number and everyone accepts SMS."</p><p>In terms of use cases for the tech, the tight end uses actually appealed to Y Combinator, one of Vimessa's backers, because "Y Combinator has lots of international members, with people in different countries, which exacerbates the time-zone situation." The idea appealed to them directly, and Clark pointed out that "The number one YC device is to make something that delights millions of people, and if you can't do that then delight a smaller amount of people. But don't ever be in the grey--don't ever be just good for everyone. Blow someone's socks off."</p><p>This cross-time zone business-appealing aspect drives the company's freemium model. "One of the problems of business travel is that you normally have a number of SIM cards rustling around in your wallet, and it becomes really annoying for [everyone else] to work out what phone number you're on. So for a small amount--$5 or $10 per month--you have a Pro account on Vimessa which lets you tie all of your phone numbers into one account. So if anyone sends you a message on any of your phone numbers, it goes to your device," says Clark.</p><p>That sounds a little like some of the cross-platform functionality that makes Google Voice so attractive. In the future, Vimessa could also work inside companies--and Clark explained that further down the road they're planning on enabling intra-company video messaging, which we imagine could be useful in terms of making tasking or praise messages from your boss more personal, more emotional (leaving less scope for misunderstanding, perhaps).</p><p>The time-zone element of the app, along with its ability to "strenghten personal relationships" is aslo played up in the company's press release in regard to sending cross time-zone messages between family members for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday (perhaps even more relevant for overseas family members or servicemen), and Clark notes that the timing of Vimessa's launch  was directed toward capturing a Thanksgiving audience.</p><p>So Vimessa is video voicemail, but for your tablet, phone and PC, with a few handy tools to make business people's lives a little simpler (and perhaps a little more complex too--it's easy to be made nervous by a ticking-off message from your boss, but perhaps a lot more nerve-wracking to see their angry face in a Vimessa clip). Would your granny be pleased to be woken up by a video message from your family on Thanksgiving? Could it be a gateway to then making a video Skype call? Its the answers to these questions, along with a predicted paradigm shift in how we see video messaging, that Vimessa's future is predicated on.</p><p>Chat about this news with Kit Eaton on Twitter and Fast Company too.</p>

In the future, Vimessa could also work inside companies--and Clark explained that further down the road they're planning on enabling intra-company video messaging, which we imagine could be useful in terms of making tasking or praise messages from your boss more personal, more emotional (leaving less scope for misunderstanding, perhaps).The time-zone element of the app, along with its ability to 'strenghten personal relationships' is aslo played up in the company's press release in regard to sending cross time-zone messages between family members for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday (perhaps even more relevant for overseas family members or servicemen), and Clark notes that the timing of Vimessa's launch  was directed toward capturing a Thanksgiving audience.So Vimessa is video voicemail, but for your tablet, phone and PC, with a few handy tools to make business people's lives a little simpler (and perhaps a little more complex too--it's easy to be made nervous by a ticking-off message from your boss, but perhaps a lot more nerve-wracking to see their angry face in a Vimessa clip). Would your granny be pleased to be woken up by a video message from your family on Thanksgiving? Could it be a gateway to then making a video Skype call? Its the answers to these questions, along with a predicted paradigm shift in how we see video messaging, that Vimessa's future is predicated on.Chat about this news with Kit Eaton on Twitter and Fast Company too.%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A  %0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/fastcompany/headlines/~3/x-aTTz1ZZh4/startup-vimessa-tries-to-reinvent-messaging-with-video%0A%0AThe L Train Notwork is brought to you by http://WeMakeCoolSh.it">Email this to myself</a></p></div><br /><br /><div>

<h3>Kindle Fire Vs. Nook Tablet: "Choice" And Trash Talk</h3>
<p class="news-date">Thu, 17 Nov 2011 09:45:53 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Austin Carr</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p></p><p></p><p><img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/walled-garden-fence.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p>
Barnes &amp; Noble CEO William Lynch has called Amazon's Kindle Fire a "deficient" media tablet. He referred to it as a "vending machine for Amazon's services," a device aimed to "lock consumers into [Amazon's] ecosystem." Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook Tablet, on the other hand, gives users choice and provides a much more "open" experience.</p><p>

That may be one of the Nook Tablet's most significant selling points, according to Lynch, but it remains to be seen if consumers will buy into it this holiday season. Barnes &amp; Noble has tried to paint Amazon's ecosystem as a walled garden, selfishly designed to sell only Amazon content and media. Yet in comparing the two devices, it's difficult to understand why the Nook Tablet is all about choice, whereas the Kindle Fire is all about Amazon. 
</p><p>
"I think it's really all about giving consumers choice rather than specific apps," says Claudia Romanini, director of developer relations at Barnes &amp; Noble, when asked what apps would attract consumers to the Nook Tablet over the Kindle Fire. "We have checked all the boxes of all the apps [users] have told us they want. It's about giving them choice and range. What we mean in terms of choice is that we don't lock a customer into a service and say, 'This is the way you're going to get to your media.'"</p><p>

The implication here is that Amazon does not give users "choice," a word Romanini repeated a half-dozen times during our interview; rather, it aims to "lock consumers into Amazon's ecosystem," as Lynch said. What's the difference? As Romanini pointed out to me, it means that, "We give [consumers] Netflix and Hulu and let them choose." </p><p>The idea is that Amazon, on the other hand, wouldn't let users choose between Netflix and Hulu because it wants its customers streaming movies and TV shows through Amazon's services, whether via a Prime subscription or Instant Video. It's an example Lynch echoed on stage when he boasted the Nook Tablet would have Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Pandora, giving users a wide range of choices for media services. "We...[have] said we're going to be much more open [than Amazon], and partner with the world's most popular media services like Netflix," Lynch said.</p><p>

There's just one problem: Kindle Fire users have access to Netflix. And Hulu Plus. And Pandora. In fact, I've been playing with the Kindle Fire since it came out, and it's hard to determine what apps the Nook Tablet has that the Kindle Fire doesn't. Romanini says Nook Tablet users would especially appreciate gaming on the device--it's why she said the company made sure to have Angry Birds and Scrabble ready at launch of the Nook Tablet. But punch open the Kindle Fire's app store, and you'll find both apps available in the gaming section.      </p><p>   

Why is it then that Barnes &amp; Noble's app ecosystem is all about choice, and Amazon's isn't? That's the question I pressed to Romanini:</p><p><strong>

Fast Company: William Lynch said Barnes &amp; Noble's ecosystem is built on choice. What about Amazon's ecosystem does not offer choice?</strong></p><p><strong>

Romanini</strong>: What we mean in terms of choice is that we don't lock a customer into a service and say, "This is the way you're going to get to your media." We give them Netflix and Hulu and let them choose. Most people have accounts with these services already. With Netflix, it goes beyond that--it's the integration that we've done. Using Netflix, you can really get a good experience. You don't have to exit our experience to enter another experience to access the content. You don't have to download the apps either--they're preloaded on the device. They're right there on the home screen for you to launch. The Kindle Fire I believe--I haven't seen one--from what I understand, the apps are in their store to download. They are not actually preloaded on the device.
</p><p><strong>
Why does that mean the Kindle Fire doesn't offer choice? Because apps aren't preloaded? If Netflix is preloaded, as it is on the Nook Tablet, aren't you almost making the choice for the consumer by building integration into the device?
</strong></p><p>
Well, the preloading is really a customer experience thing in terms of having an opportunity to access it right there if you want it. We're not forcing you to use it. If you never want to use Netflix, you never will. It's there for you for convenience sake. Again, I haven't seen a Kindle Fire. My understanding is that it comes configured so you're signed up for their Prime service in order to access video.
</p><p><strong>
They give you Prime for one month free, but you do not need it for Netflix.</strong></p><p>

You don't need to sign up for Prime to access Netflix, correct. You have to decide you want Netflix, you download it, and you use it.
</p><p><strong>
And if you decide, then you have choice?</strong></p><p>

Yes, I guess you do have a choice in that sense, from that standpoint. Perhaps it's more about the convenience. We're saying, "If you have a Netflix account, it's right here." You can just open the app.
</p><p>
"Choice" clearly isn't a legitimate selling point. And if you had any doubt about whether Amazon offered a less open ecosystem, just look to what Engadget reported yesterday: The Nook Tablet limits internal storage for non-Barnes &amp; Noble purchased content to 1GB--quite a bizarre cap for a company marketing choice and openness.     
</p><p>
What other competitive advantages does Barnes &amp; Noble have? Two that are significant. First, when Lynch showed off the Nook Tablet last week, he spent much of his presentation trashing the Kindle Fire's hardware while lauding the Nook Tablet's lighter weight, its better display, better design, better battery life, and its superior RAM and storage capacity. But for many consumers, it's not the tech specs but the price tag that is likely to catch their attention: The Kindle Fire is just $199, compared to Nook's $249. According to a range of analysts, that's the most significant competitive advantage.
</p><p>
Which leaves one last advantage: Barnes &amp; Noble's store. Not the digital competitor to Amazon. The physical outlets. Lynch has hailed the stores as a major leg up against competitors that will enable the company to market the devices in-person while offering "always-free" in-store support. "If you bought a Kindle Fire, had a question, wanted to talk an expert in person for help, where would you go? Amazon's headquarters in Seattle?" Lynch has quipped.</p><p>

Will that be enough to move Nook Tablets this holiday season? We'll have to wait and see. Reviews of the Kindle Fire have been so-so, mainly praising the device's low cost while criticizing its sluggish performance, heavy weight, and overall lack of polish. Perhaps Lynch is right and the tech specs and improved performance will outshine the $199 price tag. Maybe the reviews are likely to push the Nook Tablet ahead in the rankings. Regardless, both devices are likely to become hot holiday purchases. 
</p><p>
But two things are for certain. First, the Nook Tablet does not offer much more by way of choice and openness than Amazon's Kindle Fire. 
</p><p>
Second, and most significantly, without a competitive advantage in apps or price, Barnes &amp; Noble's biggest asset becomes its brick-and-mortar stores. For a company pinning its future on digital success, it's an odd idea of progress.</p><p>[Image: Flickr user Nouspique]</p>

<p class="news-mailme"><a href="mailto:?subject=[ltrainnotwork.com] Kindle Fire Vs. Nook Tablet: 'Choice' And Trash Talk&body=~^*^~%0A%0ASend this article to yourself by entering your email address in the to field above.%0A%0AHit send, and it will show up in your inbox when you connect to the real internet once you get off the train.%0A%0A~^*^~%0A%0A%0A%0ABarnes &amp; Noble CEO William Lynch has called Amazon's Kindle Fire a 'deficient' media tablet. He referred to it as a 'vending machine for Amazon's services,' a device aimed to 'lock consumers into [Amazon's] ecosystem.' Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook Tablet, on the other hand, gives users choice and provides a much more 'open' experience.%0A%0A%0A%0AThat may be one of the Nook Tablet's most significant selling points, according to Lynch, but it remains to be seen if consumers will buy into it this holiday season. Barnes &amp; Noble has tried to paint Amazon's ecosystem as a walled garden, selfishly designed to sell only Amazon content and media. Yet in comparing the two devices, it's difficult to understand why the Nook Tablet is all about choice, whereas the Kindle Fire is all about Amazon. %0A%0A%0A%0A'I think it's really all about giving consumers choice rather than specific apps,' says Claudia Romanini, director of developer relations at Barnes &amp; Noble, when asked what apps would attract consumers to the Nook Tablet over the Kindle Fire. 'We have checked all the boxes of all the apps [users] have told us they want. It's about giving them choice and range. What we mean in terms of choice is that we don't lock a customer into a service and say, 'This is the way you're going to get to your media.''%0A%0A%0A%0AThe implication here is that Amazon does not give users 'choice,' a word Romanini repeated a half-dozen times during our interview; rather, it aims to 'lock consumers into Amazon's ecosystem,' as Lynch said. What's the difference? As Romanini pointed out to me, it means that, 'We give [consumers] Netflix and Hulu and let them choose.' The idea is that Amazon, on the other hand, wouldn't let users choose between Netflix and Hulu because it wants its customers streaming movies and TV shows through Amazon's services, whether via a Prime subscription or Instant Video. It's an example Lynch echoed on stage when he boasted the Nook Tablet would have Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Pandora, giving users a wide range of choices for media services. 'We...[have] said we're going to be much more open [than Amazon], and partner with the world's most popular media services like Netflix,' Lynch said.%0A%0A%0A%0AThere's just one problem: Kindle Fire users have access to Netflix. And Hulu Plus. And Pandora. In fact, I've been playing with the Kindle Fire since it came out, and it's hard to determine what apps the Nook Tablet has that the Kindle Fire doesn't. Romanini says Nook Tablet users would especially appreciate gaming on the device--it's why she said the company made sure to have Angry Birds and Scrabble ready at launch of the Nook Tablet. But punch open the Kindle Fire's app store, and you'll find both apps available in the gaming section.         %0A%0A%0A%0AWhy is it then that Barnes &amp; Noble's app ecosystem is all about choice, and Amazon's isn't? That's the question I pressed to Romanini:%0A%0A%0A%0AFast Company: William Lynch said Barnes &amp; Noble's ecosystem is built on choice. What about Amazon's ecosystem does not offer choice?%0A%0A%0A%0ARomanini: What we mean in terms of choice is that we don't lock a customer into a service and say, 'This is the way you're going to get to your media.' We give them Netflix and Hulu and let them choose. Most people have accounts with these services already. With Netflix, it goes beyond that--it's the integration that we've done. Using Netflix, you can really get a good experience. You don't have to exit our experience to enter another experience to access the content. You don't have to download the apps either--they're preloaded on the device. They're right there on the home screen for you to launch. The Kindle Fire I believe--I haven't seen one--from what I understand, the apps are in their store to download. They are not actually preloaded on the device.%0A%0A%0A%0AWhy does that mean the Kindle Fire doesn't offer choice? Because apps aren't preloaded? If Netflix is preloaded, as it is on the Nook Tablet, aren't you almost making the choice for the consumer by building integration into the device?%0A%0A%0A%0AWell, the preloading is really a customer experience thing in terms of having an opportunity to access it right there if you want it. We're not forcing you to use it. If you never want to use Netflix, you never will. It's there for you for convenience sake. Again, I haven't seen a Kindle Fire.

<h3>Regina Dugan's Innovative Strategy For DARPA</h3>
<p class="news-date">Wed, 19 Oct 2011 16:08:20 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Adam L. Penenberg</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p>DARPA director 
Regina Dugan is 
bringing speed and creative thinking 
to the Pentagon.</p><p> <img alt="Dugan, shown here with the Nano Hummingbird, a miniature flying robot with a camera that can transmit live video. | Photo by Douglas Sonders" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/darpa-in.jpg-thumb.jpg" /> Dugan, shown here with the Nano Hummingbird, a miniature flying robot with a camera that can transmit live video. | Photo by Douglas Sonders </p><p><img alt="" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/next-p-hr.jpg-thumb.jpg" /><strong>In August, a hypersonic military plane</strong> flying at 20 times the speed of sound vanished into the Pacific Ocean, nine minutes after launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in Lompoc, California. The unmanned flight was an experiment conducted by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Defense Department division responsible for the development of new military technology. The plane cost millions to build, and this was the second time in two years this kind of craft had been lost. Yet Regina Dugan, DARPA's cool-blooded director, was not overly vexed. "You can't lose your nerve for the big failure because you need exactly the same nerve for the big success," Dugan had earlier told Fast Company during a 90-minute interview at DARPA headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia. </p>

I think that speed is part of the innovation process, says Dugan. If ideas arent built 
on with a sense of urgency, time can pass you by.


<p>Blistering speed and big splashes--in the Pacific and at the Pentagon--have characterized the 48-year-old Dugan's tenure as DARPA director. The first woman to hold the role, Dugan has invigorated the agency (whose inventions led to computer networking and GPS, among other technologies that have had transformative impact on civilian life) with initiatives that may fundamentally change the way the military innovates. She has centered DARPA's focus on the intersection of basic and applied research. She is so focused on speeding up the time from blue-sky idea to delivery of product that she has embraced crowdsourcing for both idea creation and manufacturing. Turning to the masses may seem antithetical to military secrecy, but Dugan's unorthodox approach fits with another goal of hers: welcoming a wider array of smaller contractors to bid for DARPA projects (including AeroVironment, which fabricated the Nano Hummingbirds on the previous page). In the mini-society known as the military industrial complex, none of this is simple or uncontroversial. Earlier this year, it was revealed that DARPA had awarded a private defense firm that Dugan founded with her father and uncle $6 million in contracts over the past several years, including $1.75 million since she became agency director. Her former firm, in which she still holds a hefty stake, also owes her $250,000 for a loan she made. Dugan says she properly recused herself from all related decisions ("There's nothing more important to me personally than ethics," she told Fast Company), but critics worry that her influence played a role; the Department of Defense's Inspector General is investigating. </p> <p> While her past is attracting attention, Dugan is firmly focused on the future. She shuns the spotlight, so much so that she requested through her deputies that Fast Company not run this story as an interview, fearing that an undue focus on her would diminish the accomplishments of her program managers (in whose ranks she dwelled several years ago). It's clear that Dugan's ambition for DARPA is limitless; her vision audacious. But the question remains: Will she succeed, or will her agenda--like that hypersonic vehicle--crash and burn like a short-lived experiment? </p>
<p><strong>FC: So, Dr. Dugan, when did you first realize you were good at math and science?</strong> Back in advanced calculus class in high school. Whenever I would speak, the other students would make computer sounds in the back of the room. Bleeping and fussing, whirring, all kinds of sounds. At moments like that I thought, Hmm, there's something different here. </p>

  Turning to the crowd <p>Three programs that are accelerating under Dugan's watch</p>
<p><strong>//Cyber Fast Track</strong> The government has had trouble keeping up with threats to America's computer networks, which are constantly evolving. The solution: Deploy unorthodox strategies divined by a motley crew of unconventional players, including hackers, hobbyists, and independent researchers, while cutting bureaucratic red tape. Developers retain intellectual-property rights. </p>
<img src="img/news/fastcompany_content/darpa-sidebar.jpg-thumb.jpg" />
<p><strong>//UAVForge</strong> DARPA is crowdsourcing the design and construction of a portable, backpack-size unmanned aerial vehicle to fly into "critical environments" and conduct surveillance. Teams of inventors post their plans to a DARPA website where the crowd can weigh in with suggestions. Top teams are invited to demo their tech at a "fly-off" where the winning group will receive $100,000. A DARPA subcontractor will build prototypes that the inventors can demonstrate in a war-fighter exercise. </p>
<p><strong>//System F6</strong> This crowdsourced approach to space-worthy hardware and software started three years ago with the goal of restructuring the way satellites, which run a minimum of $100 million to launch, are built. Instead of constructing a satellite as one big project, the idea is to break it into constituent pieces that can be built by different vendors of all sizes and specialties. Then each piece could be launched separately until all the parts join up in a virtual satellite formation in orbit, flying for the duration of the mission, and talking to each other wirelessly. </p>
<p><strong>Did you play sports?</strong> I did. My father had three girls. We were very close in age, and he coached us all in softball. He always had two of us who were split in the age groups, so I got him every other year as a coach. I played third base--and I was a catcher for a while, which I loved. You're in every play, and you get really dirty.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to engineering?</strong> For a while in high school, I thought I would be an architect because I liked the combination of technical discipline with the creative side of architecture. I was curious about everything, pulled in all directions by different subjects. But then I figured out that engineering could be every bit as creative as architecture.</p>
<p><strong>You went to Virginia Tech and got your master's there. Then what? </strong> I went to NASA. I actually got my first patent at NASA, for a system designed to refuel satellites in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>Did any of that technology work its way into launches?</strong> We did quite a bit of testing, and it might have been successful had time not passed. It just never came about because the need wasn't there. Refreshing the electronics became more important than refueling.</p>
<p><strong>Was there a lesson there? Perhaps in the amount of time it takes for innovations to work their way into the product side?</strong> I had left NASA by the time they made these decisions, so I don't know the specifics. But I do think that speed is part of the innovation process. If ideas aren't built on with a sense of urgency, time can pass you by.</p>
<p>This isn't just a problem for the government. It's a problem for everyone: The difficulty of making new ideas broadly available. And yet some ideas move quickly. Look at the progression of radio, television, the Internet, the iPod, Facebook. The acceleration in getting to millions of users has gone from 38 years to less than 4. That's something that we've paid a lot of attention to: How do we increase the speed at DARPA? </p>
<p><strong>That seems a key part of your mission since you got here--that it's not enough to be doing cutting-edge research.</strong> When deputy director Kaigham Gabriel and I got here, we understood that DARPA is one of the gems of the nation. We had been asked to take good care of her. For me, part of that meant really understanding why DARPA has this half-century of success in innovation. And the first element in DARPA's success is the power that lies at the intersection of basic science and application, in the so-called Pasteur's Quadrant. Do you know Stokes's theory of innovation? </p>
<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> Donald E. Stokes wrote a theory of innovation in the late 1990s. Till then, most people thought of innovation as a linear process. You do basic science; then you do more advanced science; then you do the application work; then you commercialize it. What Stokes suggested is that it doesn't happen that way at all. He preferred to think of it in a quadrant fashion, defining one row as very deep science and the other as light science; the two columns were a low-application drive and a high-application drive. Pasteur's Quadrant happens at the deep-science-, high-application-drive quadrant. That's DARPA's absolute power lane. It's called Pasteur's Quadrant because serious concerns about food safety drove his research.</p>

<p>A very recent example of how it works for us is the blast-gauge work that we do. Here's a big problem: TBI, traumatic brain injuries. So the way we approach it at DARPA is to say, "Okay, let's understand the basic science, the phenomenology. How is it that an encounter with a blast injures the brain? What levels of blasts cause what levels of injury? Is it the overpressure? Is it the acceleration? What is it?" A medical person from DARPA researched this and discovered it was the overpressure. And the DARPA physicist says, "We know how to measure that." Together, they devise this little blast gauge that's the size of a couple stacks of quarters [the gauge helps doctors measure a soldier's blast-exposure level, enabling better assessment of injuries]. They develop it in one year, going through four iterations of the electronics. That's fast. </p>
<p>All of this leads back to the idea of shipping products. The defense world is like a mini-society. It has to deploy to anyplace in the world on a moment's notice, and it has to work in a life-or-death situation. That kind of focus, that kind of drive to ship an application, really does inspire greater genius. And the constancy of funding that comes with that--in good times or bad, whether this party or that party is in power--also helps inspire innovation.</p>
<p><strong> You've introduced a number of projects that seem to be designed to speed up and open up innovation at DARPA.</strong> To increase the speed of innovation here, we want to increase the number of people who can contribute ideas to the creative process. We're trying to get that going with things like the Adaptive Vehicle Make program, the Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, and a whole host of space-program projects. Then there's also how we engage with the scientific and business communities. We structure programs so that we can have diversity of involvement from universities to small businesses to large businesses to garage inventors. You're looking for the maximum number of folks who can contribute ideas to the process. So we're trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where they come from, leveraging the most modern concepts of crowdsourcing and harnessing creative power. Look at the semiconductor industry. Those companies could only keep up with Moore's law by going from hundreds of chip designers focused on eking out every last electron, to hundreds of thousands of designers throughout the industry who could excel at various pieces of the design. When you open up the process like that, the number of people and the diversity of people who can participate goes way up.</p>

<p><strong>DARPA is known for top, top secret technologies. Yet with some of these crowdsourcing experiments [see "Turning to the Crowd"], you are transparently setting up websites where anyone can upload a video of their experiment. How do you reconcile these two opposing ideas?</strong> We have to do both. I'm sure you're familiar with James Surowiecki's book [The Wisdom of Crowds]. He has this great story of Francis Galton's visit to a livestock show in 1906. Galton's motive was to show that the average person wasn't very smart. His basic theory was we should leave government to the smart few and not to the masses. So he came upon this contest to guess the weight of a butchered and dressed ox. And what he discovered, quite to his frustration, was that the crowd was, in fact, exceedingly smart. The mean, as predicted by the crowd, was 1,197 pounds, and the actual weight was 1,198 pounds. It was a profound outcome.</p>
<p><strong>When former Secretary of Defense [Robert] Gates and his deputy interviewed you, did they ask how you'd change DARPA? Or is it the case that you were appointed and then made decisions on how best to proceed?</strong> When I first arrived, there was a lot of debate about whether the agency would get pulled more in the direction of basic science or more toward applied research. Obviously, I consider that a false choice. Probably the single biggest reason that I came back to serve here was that I believed lack of adaptability is a vulnerability in and of itself. This is something that has to be addressed specifically: the ability to adapt.</p>

Were trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where 
they come from, leveraging the most modern concepts 
of crowdsourcing, says Dugan.

<p><strong>So getting your employees to buy in is a huge deal. Tell me about your first days on the job.</strong> I decided that I had to meet every single person in the agency. At that time, there were 217--I know the number precisely! So I did it in back-to-back 10-minute meetings. The deputy director and I met everyone. </p>
<p><strong>What did you get out of that? </strong> It was valuable to me, disproportionate to my expectations. These are the musicians in this DARPA orchestra. </p>
<p><strong>That sounds like a crazy few weeks. </strong> Yes, but that was only the first step. The next was to understand the portfolio of projects. And that was as awesome a task as meeting everyone. And it takes even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Are you always a 60-to-80-hour-a-week worker?</strong> The first year and the second have been at a really crushing pace. But that kind of intensity is important. I tell young people who ask me about their careers, "Wake up on Saturday and ask yourself, Which job would I go to right now? Then choose that one." Because what it tells you is that you're going to your passion; your passion is your work. And I feel that way about my work. </p>

Then each piece could be launched separately until all the parts join up in a virtual satellite formation in orbit, flying for the duration of the mission, and talking to each other wirelessly. %0A%0ADid you play sports? I did. My father had three girls. We were very close in age, and he coached us all in softball. He always had two of us who were split in the age groups, so I got him every other year as a coach. I played third base--and I was a catcher for a while, which I loved. You're in every play, and you get really dirty.%0A%0AWhat attracted you to engineering? For a while in high school, I thought I would be an architect because I liked the combination of technical discipline with the creative side of architecture. I was curious about everything, pulled in all directions by different subjects. But then I figured out that engineering could be every bit as creative as architecture.%0A%0AYou went to Virginia Tech and got your master's there. Then what?  I went to NASA. I actually got my first patent at NASA, for a system designed to refuel satellites in orbit.%0A%0ADid any of that technology work its way into launches? We did quite a bit of testing, and it might have been successful had time not passed. It just never came about because the need wasn't there. Refreshing the electronics became more important than refueling.%0A%0AWas there a lesson there? Perhaps in the amount of time it takes for innovations to work their way into the product side? I had left NASA by the time they made these decisions, so I don't know the specifics. But I do think that speed is part of the innovation process. If ideas aren't built on with a sense of urgency, time can pass you by.%0A%0AThis isn't just a problem for the government. It's a problem for everyone: The difficulty of making new ideas broadly available. And yet some ideas move quickly. Look at the progression of radio, television, the Internet, the iPod, Facebook. The acceleration in getting to millions of users has gone from 38 years to less than 4. That's something that we've paid a lot of attention to: How do we increase the speed at DARPA? %0A%0AThat seems a key part of your mission since you got here--that it's not enough to be doing cutting-edge research. When deputy director Kaigham Gabriel and I got here, we understood that DARPA is one of the gems of the nation. We had been asked to take good care of her. For me, part of that meant really understanding why DARPA has this half-century of success in innovation. And the first element in DARPA's success is the power that lies at the intersection of basic science and application, in the so-called Pasteur's Quadrant. Do you know Stokes's theory of innovation? %0A%0AAbsolutely not. Donald E. Stokes wrote a theory of innovation in the late 1990s. Till then, most people thought of innovation as a linear process. You do basic science; then you do more advanced science; then you do the application work; then you commercialize it. What Stokes suggested is that it doesn't happen that way at all. He preferred to think of it in a quadrant fashion, defining one row as very deep science and the other as light science; the two columns were a low-application drive and a high-application drive. Pasteur's Quadrant happens at the deep-science-, high-application-drive quadrant. That's DARPA's absolute power lane. It's called Pasteur's Quadrant because serious concerns about food safety drove his research.%0A%0A Photo by Douglas Sonders%0A%0A%0A%0AA very recent example of how it works for us is the blast-gauge work that we do. Here's a big problem: TBI, traumatic brain injuries. So the way we approach it at DARPA is to say, 'Okay, let's understand the basic science, the phenomenology. How is it that an encounter with a blast injures the brain? What levels of blasts cause what levels of injury? Is it the overpressure? Is it the acceleration? What is it?' A medical person from DARPA researched this and discovered it was the overpressure. And the DARPA physicist says, 'We know how to measure that.' Together, they devise this little blast gauge that's the size of a couple stacks of quarters [the gauge helps doctors measure a soldier's blast-exposure level, enabling better assessment of injuries]. They develop it in one year, going through four iterations of the electronics. That's fast. %0A%0AAll of this leads back to the idea of shipping products. The defense world is like a mini-society. It has to deploy to anyplace in the world on a moment's notice, and it has to work in a life-or-death situation. That kind of focus, that kind of drive to ship an application, really does inspire greater genius. And the constancy of funding that comes with that--in good times or bad, whether this party or that party is in power--also helps inspire innovation.%0A%0A You've introduced a number of projects that seem to be designed to speed up and open up innovation at DARPA. To increase the speed of innovation here, we want to increase the number of people who can contribute ideas to the creative process. We're trying to get that going with things like the Adaptive Vehicle Make program, the Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, and a whole host of space-program projects. Then there's also how we engage with the scientific and business communities. We structure programs so that we can have diversity of involvement from universities to small businesses to large businesses to garage inventors. You're looking for the maximum number of folks who can contribute ideas to the process. So we're trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where they come from, leveraging the most modern concepts of crowdsourcing and harnessing creative power. Look at the semiconductor industry. Those companies could only keep up with Moore's law by going from hundreds of chip designers focused on eking out every last electron, to hundreds of thousands of designers throughout the industry who could excel at various pieces of the design. When you open up the process like that, the number of people and the diversity of people who can participate goes way up.%0A%0A Jay Rogers, CEO of Local Motors (left), and DARPAs Nathan Wiedenman look on as Dugan shakes President Barack Obamas hand. The XC2V (behind), a combat test vehicle designed through crowdsourcing, was unveiled at Carnegie Mellon University, in June. | Photo by Douglas Sonders %0A%0A%0A%0ADARPA is known for top, top secret technologies. Yet with some of these crowdsourcing experiments [see 'Turning to the Crowd'], you are transparently setting up websites where anyone can upload a video of their experiment. How do you reconcile these two opposing ideas? We have to do both. I'm sure you're familiar with James Surowiecki's book [The Wisdom of Crowds]. He has this great story of Francis Galton's visit to a livestock show in 1906. Galton's motive was to show that the average person wasn't very smart. His basic theory was we should leave government to the smart few and not to the masses. So he came upon this contest to guess the weight of a butchered and dressed ox. And what he discovered, quite to his frustration, was that the crowd was, in fact, exceedingly smart. The mean, as predicted by the crowd, was 1,197 pounds, and the actual weight was 1,198 pounds. It was a profound outcome.%0A%0AWhen former Secretary of Defense [Robert] Gates and his deputy interviewed you, did they ask how you'd change DARPA? Or is it the case that you were appointed and then made decisions on how best to proceed? When I first arrived, there was a lot of debate about whether the agency would get pulled more in the direction of basic science or more toward applied research. Obviously, I consider that a false choice. Probably the single biggest reason that I came back to serve here was that I believed lack of adaptability is a vulnerability in and of itself. This is something that has to be addressed specifically: the ability to adapt.%0A%0A%0A%0AWere trying to catalyze and grab the best ideas no matter where %0A%0Athey come from, leveraging the most modern concepts %0A%0Aof crowdsourcing, says Dugan.%0A%0A%0A%0ASo getting your employees to buy in is a huge deal. Tell me about your first days on the job. I decided that I had to meet every single person in the agency. At that time, there were 217--I know the number precisely! So I did it in back-to-back 10-minute meetings. The deputy director and I met everyone. %0A%0AWhat did you get out of that?  It was valuable to me, disproportionate to my expectations. These are the musicians in this DARPA orchestra. %0A%0AThat sounds like a crazy few weeks.  Yes, but that was only the first step. The next was to understand the portfolio of projects. And that was as awesome a task as meeting everyone. And it takes even longer.%0A%0AAre you always a 60-to-80-hour-a-week worker? The first year and the second have been at a really crushing pace. But that kind of intensity is important. I tell young people who ask me about their careers, 'Wake up on Saturday and ask yourself, Which job would I go to right now? Then choose that one.' Because what it tells you is that you're going to your passion; your passion is your work. And I feel that way about my work. %0A%0ARelated:%0A%0AThe Anti-Sub Game%0A%0AThe Wisdom Of Cars%0A%0A%0A%0AA version of this article appears in the November 2011 issue of Fast Company.%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A  %0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/fastcompany/headlines/~3/XaAKHz_ydNE/regina-dugan-darpa%0A%0AThe L Train Notwork is brought to you by http://WeMakeCoolSh.it">Email this to myself</a></p></div><br /><br /><div>

<h3>Why Google Music Targets Social And The Cloud</h3>
<p class="news-date">Wed, 16 Nov 2011 18:26:12 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Austin Carr</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p></p><p></p><p><img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/boom-boom-boom.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p>
Google launched its long-overdue music store today, roughly eight years into the reign of Apple's iTunes Store, which just sold its 16 billionth song. Clearly Google has a lot of catching up to do--and that's just with Apple. Amazon has had a digital music store since 2007 that's known for its aggressive pricing, while Facebook recently integrated third-party streaming services such as Spotify, Rhapsody, Rdio, and MOG.
</p><p>
Why has Google entered such a saturated market? Call it another battle in the Great Tech War of 2012, with the big four (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon) now duking it out over the music industry. But none of these companies are actually expecting to make significant revenues from selling music. They're interested in bolstering the products the music runs on.
</p><p>
In other words, while Apple controls roughly 70% of the music market, iTunes is largely expected to be a break-even business. The real revenues come from complementary businesses: iTunes helps drive sales of iPods and iPhones; it entices consumers to buy iPads and Macs, so they have access to their music on all their devices in one vertical family of products; and it is soon to drive subscriptions to services like iCloud, which keeps all your music in the cloud accessible from anywhere for an annual fee. </p><p>

That's why Google today launched its music store and opened up its Google Music Beta cloud service to the public--not to sell music, but rather to improve the experience of its web and mobile products. Now, users can store up to 20,000 songs online for free, accessible from any web browser. The music can be streamed to most Android devices (tablets and smartphones running Android 2.2+); additionally, if you're hopping on a plane, music from your library can be pinned to your device, read for offline play. </p><p>The point here isn't necessarily to attack iTunes, though that's one obvious consequence. There are myriad benefits for Google beyond selling MP3s. The store, launched today in the Android market, will help drive sales of Android devices (though&nbsp;it's&nbsp;unclear how much money&nbsp;Google will ever make from the OS). Google said it has activated more than 200 million Android devices. Such reach is beneficial for the labels that want to sell more music, and for Google, which wants to sell more Android devices--it's already adding roughly 550,000 new devices each day now. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Google Music will also bolster consumer use of Google's cloud services. "Other cloud services think you have to pay to listen to music you already own," said Google's Jamie Rosenberg in an explicit swipe at Apple and Amazon. "We don't." While free for now, I would expect Google to charge for similar services down the road, especially as it continues to push its cloud-based Chromebooks.</p><p>Most importantly, Google Music will add a new social layer to Google+. As demonstrated today, Google Music enables users to share purchased music with friends on Google's recently launched social network. After purchasing a song, users have the option to recommend music in their Google+ stream. Followers can stream the whole track, and not just some "90-second preview," said Google in yet another shot at Apple. Plus, the sharing isn't limited to individual tracks. If you purchase an album, the entire thing can be shared with friends on Google+.&nbsp;</p><p>Music might be&nbsp;another "dangerous decoy,"&nbsp;as&nbsp;Farhad Manjoo&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;in his cover story on the Great Tech War,&nbsp;a service outside Google's primary focus that can have indirect benefits on its core businesses. It's what Andy Grove might call a complementor.&nbsp;The question here is two-fold: whether Google is too late to the game already with music, and whether music is one too many degrees separated from Google's core businesses of search and advertising.&nbsp;</p><p>But Google couldn't afford to wait much longer. Yesterday,&nbsp;Apple launched its much anticipated iTunes Match service, which will scan and match your library in the cloud for $25 a year. Amazon released its first media tablet, the Kindle Fire, which is supported by Amazon services like its music store and Cloud Drive. And Facebook last week&nbsp;boasted&nbsp;just how much its open graph is boosting the popularity of startups like Spotify and MOG, which are in turn driving more usership and sharing on Facebook. </p><p>No wonder Google seemingly rushed the service out the door with just three of the four major record labels onboard.</p><p>[image flickr user viamoi]</p>

Amazon has had a digital music store since 2007 that's known for its aggressive pricing, while Facebook recently integrated third-party streaming services such as Spotify, Rhapsody, Rdio, and MOG.%0A%0A%0A%0AWhy has Google entered such a saturated market? Call it another battle in the Great Tech War of 2012, with the big four (Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon) now duking it out over the music industry. But none of these companies are actually expecting to make significant revenues from selling music. They're interested in bolstering the products the music runs on.%0A%0A%0A%0AIn other words, while Apple controls roughly 70% of the music market, iTunes is largely expected to be a break-even business. The real revenues come from complementary businesses: iTunes helps drive sales of iPods and iPhones; it entices consumers to buy iPads and Macs, so they have access to their music on all their devices in one vertical family of products; and it is soon to drive subscriptions to services like iCloud, which keeps all your music in the cloud accessible from anywhere for an annual fee. %0A%0A%0A%0AThat's why Google today launched its music store and opened up its Google Music Beta cloud service to the public--not to sell music, but rather to improve the experience of its web and mobile products. Now, users can store up to 20,000 songs online for free, accessible from any web browser. The music can be streamed to most Android devices (tablets and smartphones running Android 2.2+); additionally, if you're hopping on a plane, music from your library can be pinned to your device, read for offline play. The point here isn't necessarily to attack iTunes, though that's one obvious consequence. There are myriad benefits for Google beyond selling MP3s. The store, launched today in the Android market, will help drive sales of Android devices (though&nbsp;it's&nbsp;unclear how much money&nbsp;Google will ever make from the OS). Google said it has activated more than 200 million Android devices. Such reach is beneficial for the labels that want to sell more music, and for Google, which wants to sell more Android devices--it's already adding roughly 550,000 new devices each day now. &nbsp;&nbsp;Google Music will also bolster consumer use of Google's cloud services. 'Other cloud services think you have to pay to listen to music you already own,' said Google's Jamie Rosenberg in an explicit swipe at Apple and Amazon. 'We don't.' While free for now, I would expect Google to charge for similar services down the road, especially as it continues to push its cloud-based Chromebooks.Most importantly, Google Music will add a new social layer to Google+. As demonstrated today, Google Music enables users to share purchased music with friends on Google's recently launched social network. After purchasing a song, users have the option to recommend music in their Google+ stream. Followers can stream the whole track, and not just some '90-second preview,' said Google in yet another shot at Apple. Plus, the sharing isn't limited to individual tracks. If you purchase an album, the entire thing can be shared with friends on Google+.&nbsp;Music might be&nbsp;another 'dangerous decoy,'&nbsp;as&nbsp;Farhad Manjoo&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;in his cover story on the Great Tech War,&nbsp;a service outside Google's primary focus that can have indirect benefits on its core businesses. It's what Andy Grove might call a complementor.&nbsp;The question here is two-fold: whether Google is too late to the game already with music, and whether music is one too many degrees separated from Google's core businesses of search and advertising.&nbsp;But Google couldn't afford to wait much longer. Yesterday,&nbsp;Apple launched its much anticipated iTunes Match service, which will scan and match your library in the cloud for $25 a year. Amazon released its first media tablet, the Kindle Fire, which is supported by Amazon services like its music store and Cloud Drive. And Facebook last week&nbsp;boasted&nbsp;just how much its open graph is boosting the popularity of startups like Spotify and MOG, which are in turn driving more usership and sharing on Facebook. No wonder Google seemingly rushed the service out the door with just three of the four major record labels onboard.[image flickr user viamoi]%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A  %0A%0A%0A%0Ahttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/fastcompany/headlines/~3/5c_C98w_nZ0/why-google-music-targets-icloud-not-itunes%0A%0AThe L Train Notwork is brought to you by http://WeMakeCoolSh.it">Email this to myself</a></p></div><br /><br /><div>

<h3>Benetton Courts Controversy With World Leader Lip-Locks</h3>
<p class="news-date">Thu, 17 Nov 2011 10:27:17 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Joe Berkowitz</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p>For its "Unhate" campaign, the fashion retailer mocks up face-sucking scenarios between U.S. Prez Barack Obama and Chinas Supreme Leader Hu Jintao and the Pope and a prominent Imam (among others). There's even a way for you to get in on the hot dignitary action!</p><p></p><p><img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/benetton-obama1.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p>
<p>
If youve ever wondered what it might look like to see Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tenderly kissing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas--and who hasnt?--wonder no more. With its latest ad campaign, Benetton is courting controversy once again by prominently featuring images of world leaders sharing intimate moments. (Don't worry, there's no tongue.)</p>
<p>Benetton's lofty new initiative, "Unhate," launches today and is an amplified version of the same tolerance message the company has publicly espoused since at least the 1980s, when ethnically harmonious bands of young models gathered together in ads, which became pop-cultural shorthand for diversity. (As in, "Yeah, that pre-school in the East Village/Silver Lake looks like a Benetton ad!")</p><p>And it wouldn't be complete without some righteous indignation. Right on cue,&nbsp;a spokesperson representing Pope Benedict XVI asked to recall a version of the ad showing his holiness kissing Ahmed Mohamed el-Tayeb, the head of the Al-Azhar mosque in Cairo. "This is a grave lack of respect for the pope, an offense against the sentiments of the faithful and a clear example of how advertising can violate elementary rules for people in order to attract attention through provocation," a Vatican official said on Wednesday.</p><p><img alt="" border="0" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/Pope-Al Tayeb ITAL.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p><strong>[See more images from the campaign at Co.Exist]</strong></p><p>On its Facebook page, Benetton gave its official response: "We reiterate that the meaning of this campaign is exclusively to combat the culture of hatred in all its forms. We are therefore sorry that the use of the image of the Pope and the Imam has so offended the sentiments of the faithful. In corroboration of our intentions, we have decided, with immediate effect, to withdraw this image from every publication." There are more elements to the campaign than just the ad, though.</p>
<p>
The new initiative, created by agency 72andSunny, in conjunction with Benetton's creative unit, Fabrica, goes far beyond those peaceful youth summits mentioned above, returning to the gritty vein of some of the companys previous ads, which contained nudity and directly confronted topics such as AIDS and the death penalty. 
In an extension of the campaign idea, Benetton has formed The Unhate Foundation, which promotes closeness between cultures, races, and religions, and brings topical hate issues to the attention of the mainstream public. (Our) objective was to help Benetton reclaim its relevance and insert the brand in a broader cultural conversation," says 72andSunny creative director Carlo Cavallone. "In many ways this is a return to Benettons roots as a disruptive marketer."
</p><p>French filmmaker Laurent Chanez was recruited to make a short film for the Unhate foundation, which is set to play before previews in movie theatres, and circulate online. In it, a multitude of people from regions all over the world are shown in various states of embracefriends greeting each other, boxers touching gloves, lovers canoodling. After a sudden shift, though, more people are shown in similarly close quarters, only now theyre fighting. The discord escalates in intensity, lead along by a violin-fronted orchestra, from images of schoolyard bullying to footage from Arab Spring, with scenes of a warehouse party thrown in for extra disorientation. Finally, the clip ends with tight shots of multi-ethnic couples kissing (this is Benetton after all), hammering home the message that love and hate are like identical Winklevoss Twins both played by the same actor.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The November 16 launch begins with a big event in the Benetton flagship Haussman in Paris, where Allesandro Benetton will be on hand. Coinciding with the event, the print ads, which alternately feature Kim Jong Il, Lee Myung-Bak, and other world leaders rounding first base, should begin seeping into the public eye via guerilla postings in key cities around the globe, including Milan, Tel Aviv, and New York City. 
</p>
<p>
The clothing company has also made space for user-generated content on its website with The Unhate Kiss Wall, where viewers can upload, say, images of a dog and a cat, and then see the two animals tenderly kissing, symbolizing the end of interspecies domestic abuse.</p>
<p>
In other acts of animal symbolism, Benetton Creative Director Erik Ravelo has created The Unhate Dove, which is a piece of art the size of a modest two-story house, made entirely from spent bullets collected in hot war zones around the world. The image of the dove will be visible in Benetton stores and online, and the art itself will be exhibited around the world to promote the campaign.
</p>
<p>
The highly charged controversial imagery in the new print ads assures that the ads themselves, and Benetton, will enter the national discussion. Whether people are ready to accept President Barack Obama and Chinas Supreme Leader Hu Jintao swapping spit in the name of a clothing retailer is anyones guess.

<h3>Will Working Remotely Work? 7 "What If" Scenarios To Consider First</h3>
<p class="news-date">Wed, 16 Nov 2011 06:42:43 EST</p>
<p class="news-author">Cali Williams Yost</p>
<div class="news-summary">
<p>The goal: to make working remotely look and feel as seamless as possible for your boss, your colleagues, and your customers. </p><p></p><p><img alt="" src="img/news/fastcompany_content/inline-working-away-thinkabout.jpg-thumb.jpg" /></p><p>For almost two decades, Ive helped organizations implement work life flexibility strategies. And Ive learned that the difference between success and failure with any type of flexible work, including remote work, often comes down to contingency planning. In other words, answering the question what if x happens... to as many scenarios as you can possibly think of upfront. </p> <p>Nothing drives a manager crazier than to call an employee who is working remotely and not be able to or reach him her.&nbsp;Nothing depresses a remote worker more than to be consistently passed over for high-profile, last minute projects because its easier to give it to someone in the office.</p> <p>Its more difficult to address these situations after the fact than it is to plan how you could handle them in advance. Misunderstandings are minimized because everyone is on the same page.&nbsp;This doesnt mean there wont be unforeseen challenges that pop up. But for the most part, my number-one tip for successful remote work is to ask yourself, your boss, and your team, What if...? before you start.</p> <p><strong>The goal: to make working remotely look and feel as seamless as possible for your boss, your colleagues, and your customers.&nbsp;</strong>Everyone is already too busy doing too much work. You want to minimize the chance that someone will have to work harder so that you can work more flexibly.</p> <p>Here are the most common and problematic scenarios that can be easily avoided with some pre-planning:</p> <p><strong>What if...you are talking to someone from work on the phone and your dog barks?</strong></p> <p>This is the top complaint I hear from managers about their employees who work from home: background animal (and kid) noises. Im not sure why this drives them so crazy other than its a red flag that says "I'm not working in an official office," and they dont want clients or customers to know that. In the spirit of creating as seamless a transition as possible, try to keep your pets and kids separate from where you're working.</p> <p><strong>What if...your babysitter gets sick or your kids have a snow day?</strong></p> <p>Remote work cant be a substitute for child care. Im consistently surprised by how many people struggle with this. The rule of thumb I follow is to handle child care the same way you would if you worked in an office. Have a contingency plan in place for what you will do if your sitter calls in sick or your kids have a snow day. For example, identify someone in advance who can come in to cover, and dont assume it will be you.</p> <p><strong>What if...someone from work (especially your boss) tries to reach you and you dont respond immediately?</strong></p> <p>Im somewhat mystified by why managers expect immediate response from remote workers since people working in the office arent always at their desk. But for many managers, quick and easy access to you is a clear sign that youre working, not watching The Price Is Right (which is their deepest fear). If you happen to miss a call or IM from someone at work, reply as soon as possible. Dont offer a lot of excuses, just explain what happened: "Im sorry; I was on another call," or "I stepped away for a moment. How can I help you?"</p> <p><strong>What if...theres an important meeting scheduled in the office on your remote work day?</strong></p> <p>Be flexible with your flexibility. In todays volatile, ever-changing global economy, change is inevitable and we have to roll with it. This includes being willing to alter your remote working schedule periodically to accommodate important meetings or projects that require face-to-face interaction in the office.</p> <p><strong>What if...your internet service goes down?</strong></p> <p>Reliable technology is one of the keys to successful remote work. That includes a reliable internet and phone connection. If your mobile phone has spotty service, install a land line.&nbsp; I your internet service is unreliable, get a backup mobile wifi card. You may decide that these investments are valuable insurance that supports your ability to continue to work remotely.</p> <p><strong>What if...a last minute important project lands on your bosss desk at the end of the day?</strong></p> <p>Back in 1975, when critical customer information could only be found in paper files, last-minute projects had to be handled in an office. But today, most of information that you will need to respond rapidly to an important problem or opportunity can be accessed or shared remotely from the cloud. The challenge now is for your boss to think of you as these issues arise if you arent physically present. </p> <p>The trick is to communicate often when youre working remotely without being annoying. First, let your boss know that even though you are working remotely youre available and happy to step in and help anytime.&nbsp; Second, periodically (once or twice a day) touch base with a quick email or IM just to check in. That keeps you in the front of her mind should any challenges arise. </p> <p><strong>What if...someone from work calls and youre putting a load of laundry in the washing machine?</strong></p> <p>I mention this scenario because it came up on a recent manager webinar I conducted for a client. The manager said, I was on the phone with an employee who works from home and all of a sudden I hear a splash and a scream, then the line goes dead. Im thinking What the heck? Then she calls me and apologizes by saying I was putting a load of laundry in and dropped the phone into the tub. See, this is why I hate people working from home. The moral of this story is that if you're working from home, then work. Yes, throw a load of laundry in, grab a sandwich, go to the bathroom, but make it fast and dont do it when youre on the phone with your boss or a client.</p> <p>So much of this is common sense but surprisingly few people think these situations through beforehand and end up sabotaging their ability to work remotely<strong>. </strong></p><p><strong> </strong>What other What if... scenarios can you think of?</p> <p>(This post was inspired by Microsofts Your Office, Your Terms campaign to support women and remote work.&nbsp; Check it out)&nbsp; Also, I invite you to connect with me on my Work+Life Fit blog and on Twitter @caliyost.</p><p>[image flickr user novencito]</p>

For almost two decades, Ive helped organizations implement work life flexibility strategies. And Ive learned that the difference between success and failure with any type of flexible work, including remote work, often comes down to contingency planning. In other words, answering the question what if x happens... to as many scenarios as you can possibly think of upfront.  Nothing drives a manager crazier than to call an employee who is working remotely and not be able to or reach him her.&nbsp;Nothing depresses a remote worker more than to be consistently passed over for high-profile, last minute projects because its easier to give it to someone in the office. Its more difficult to address these situations after the fact than it is to plan how you could handle them in advance. Misunderstandings are minimized because everyone is on the same page.&nbsp;This doesnt mean there wont be unforeseen challenges that pop up. But for the most part, my number-one tip for successful remote work is to ask yourself, your boss, and your team, What if...? before you start. The goal: to make working remotely look and feel as seamless as possible for your boss, your colleagues, and your customers.&nbsp;Everyone is already too busy doing too much work. You want to minimize the chance that someone will have to work harder so that you can work more flexibly. Here are the most common and problematic scenarios that can be easily avoided with some pre-planning: What if...you are talking to someone from work on the phone and your dog barks? This is the top complaint I hear from managers about their employees who work from home: background animal (and kid) noises. Im not sure why this drives them so crazy other than its a red flag that says 'I'm not working in an official office,' and they dont want clients or customers to know that. In the spirit of creating as seamless a transition as possible, try to keep your pets and kids separate from where you're working. What if...your babysitter gets sick or your kids have a snow day? Remote work cant be a substitute for child care. Im consistently surprised by how many people struggle with this. The rule of thumb I follow is to handle child care the same way you would if you worked in an office. Have a contingency plan in place for what you will do if your sitter calls in sick or your kids have a snow day. For example, identify someone in advance who can come in to cover, and dont assume it will be you. What if...someone from work (especially your boss) tries to reach you and you dont respond immediately? Im somewhat mystified by why managers expect immediate response from remote workers since people working in the office arent always at their desk. But for many managers, quick and easy access to you is a clear sign that youre working, not watching The Price Is Right (which is their deepest fear). If you happen to miss a call or IM from someone at work, reply as soon as possible. Dont offer a lot of excuses, just explain what happened: 'Im sorry; I was on another call,' or 'I stepped away for a moment. How can I help you?' What if...theres an important meeting scheduled in the office on your remote work day? Be flexible with your flexibility. In todays volatile, ever-changing global economy, change is inevitable and we have to roll with it. This includes being willing to alter your remote working schedule periodically to accommodate important meetings or projects that require face-to-face interaction in the office. What if...your internet service goes down? Reliable technology is one of the keys to successful remote work. That includes a reliable internet and phone connection. If your mobile phone has spotty service, install a land line.&nbsp; I your internet service is unreliable, get a backup mobile wifi card. You may decide that these investments are valuable insurance that supports your ability to continue to work remotely. What if...a last minute important project lands on your bosss desk at the end of the day? Back in 1975, when critical customer information could only be found in paper files, last-minute projects had to be handled in an office. But today, most of information that you will need to respond rapidly to an important problem or opportunity can be accessed or shared remotely from the cloud. The challenge now is for your boss to think of you as these issues arise if you arent physically present.  The trick is to communicate often when youre working remotely without being annoying. First, let your boss know that even though you are working remotely youre available and happy to step in and help anytime.&nbsp; Second, periodically (once or twice a day) touch base with a quick email or IM just to check in. That keeps you in the front of her mind should any challenges arise.  What if...someone from work calls and youre putting a load of laundry in the washing machine? I mention this scenario because it came up on a recent manager webinar I conducted for a client. The manager said, I was on the phone with an employee who works from home and all of a sudden I hear a splash and a scream, then the line goes dead. Im thinking What the heck? Then she calls me and apologizes by saying I was putting a load of laundry in and dropped the phone into the tub. See, this is why I hate people working from home. The moral of this story is that if you're working from home, then work. Yes, throw a load of laundry in, grab a sandwich, go to the bathroom, but make it fast and dont do it when youre on the phone with your boss or a client. So much of this is common sense but surprisingly few people think these situations through beforehand and end up sabotaging their ability to work remotely.  What other What if... scenarios can you think of?
