<img alt='Photos/Video: Protesters Outside Of People Magazine Declare Ryan Gosling Is The "Sexiest Man Alive"' src="img/news/gothamist_content/rygo111611_restrict_width_110.jpeg-thumb.jpg" /> Earlier today masked protesters were spotted outside of the People magazine's headquarters&#8212;with their spirits unbroken, and their voices raised loud. These people were Ryan Gosling fans, and/or Buzzfeed employees, who are simply outraged that the magazine declared actor Bradley Cooper to be the sexiest man alive this year. Did their protest affect change? No. But they fought the good fight. And while no injuries have been reported, we're betting there are some broken hearts amongst these brave men and women.

But while this will be good for competition across the league, it probably doesn't mean much to Mets fans out there right now, who are facing another disappointing, disheartening season, this time likely without star shortstop Jose Reyes. And prominent Mets supporter Jerry Seinfeld told David Letterman he's dealing with the stress in a unique way: by naming his new dog "Jose Reyes." Watch below:

As you can see from his mug shot, 22-year-old Kevin Daly is one of the many proud Americans who are "owning it," at a time when more of us should really be renting. Yes, Daly was arrested wearing a T-shirt that reads "I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC. I'M A DRUNK. ALCOHOLICS GO TO MEETINGS." What makes this story seem even more contrived is that the cop car that Daly hit <em>was part of a special drunk driving unit, </em>the Suffolk County Police Department&#8217;s SAFE-T (Selective Alcohol Fatality Enforcement Team) Section. It seems SAFE-T officers don't really have to go out of their way to bust drunk drivers on Long Island.

<img alt="Penn State, Police, Deny McQueary Reported Sandusky's Sexual Antics" src="img/news/gothamist_content/20111_mcquearyCBS_restrict_width_110.jpg-thumb.jpg" /> Whatever Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State football coach charged with sexually abusing a string of young boys, was hoping to get from his much-maligned interview with Bob Costas earlier this week it doesn't seem to be working. His claims that sexual misconduct was just "horseplay" has reportedly emboldened a number of other alleged victims to come forward while firming the resolve of those who already spoke out. Meanwhile, more questions are being asked about Mike McQueary, the assistant coach currently on paid leave whose testimony against Sandusky is key to the case. For instance? Turns out McQueary went to a fundraiser for Sandusky's charity a year <em>after</em> he says he saw him raping a 10-year-old in the Penn State showers.

<img alt="Allegedly Creepy Bronx HS Principal Finds Copy Machine Quite Sexy" src="img/news/gothamist_content/111711chase_restrict_height_110.jpg-thumb.jpg" /> Officials are investigating allegations that a Bronx high school principal has repeatedly harassed teachers by talking about his penis. At least two female teachers have filed complaints about Bronxdale High School principal John Chase Jr., and one even filed a harassment report with the local police precinct because he, in the words of the Post, "proudly prattled about putting his Peter into school office orifices." As one angry staffer told them,  <strong>&#8220;The fact that he&#8217;s still in the building is absurd. He keeps talking about his dick.&#8221;</strong>

While in the past pancakes may have been on top, waffles are now <em>sweeping the nation</em> (unsubstantiated!)&#8212;this week MSNBC even offered up an entire selection from various cities. And while we may be drooling over one Chicago plate (fried soft-shell crab on top of a savory Old Bay-seasoned waffle!), New York City is repping as well. Welcome back, the boys at Do or Dine, who seem to have an endless amount of tricks up their aprons.
