<h3>By Jon Sands<br />
after Pablo Neruda</h3>

<p>Why can’t ceramic bowls eat fruit salad out of me?<br />
Why can’t I ever get my watch to its appointments on time?<br />
Why can’t <i>Braveheart</i> be a little embarrassed by how much it liked me? <br />
Why isn’t rent money concerned if I’ll be ready this Saturday?</p>

<p>Why can’t my bedroom only really be itself around me? <br />
What if my clothes are just using me to look fresh?<br />
Why isn’t my roommate proud of me for coming home drunk and eating his food?<br />
What if I shit on a bird?</p>

<p>What if the floor and ceiling could kiss?<br />
What if my dreams always forget me?<br />
What if God isn’t convinced I’m real, and loses sleep over it?<br />
What if my alarm clock could sleep in?</p>

<p>Why can’t my six-week old nephew just talk already?<br />
Why can’t sex say that I change everything?<br />
Why can’t love fall madly in Jon?</p>
