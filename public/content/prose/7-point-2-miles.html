&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those days when I wake up and feel like I'm falling, I walk the city. I cross the Williamsburg bridge on foot, imagining every step makes the distance between us literal. I stop at a café to collect my thoughts, but I know I should have left them on the bridge. As if you were chasing me, I check to see if you are there while I drink the coffee, and of course you are.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pick up my cup and keep walking, trying to find the city I knew before you. Before I didn’t know you. Looking down at my feet I am alone with you again, so I look around. But I am still too shy to be naked in front of so many strangers, so finally I look up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn the skyscrapers into my canopy of trees and let the dappled light hit my face like a splash of cool water and redemption. By the time I see the Flatiron, my mind is like a fist finally becoming a hand again. My legs are tired and I’m no longer aware of the effort, only the feeling of motion. I understand that I’m walking but it feels like swimming, like I could reach up and pull myself out of this place by grabbing a windowsill like it’s the side of a pool.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel guilty about something, you asked, and repeated, stunning me and leveling your gaze, lowering your head like a bull preparing his charge, no matter my answer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I whispered, rising inside myself, taller and defiant but confused and falling, hearing things inside me already breaking, a pile of china I know I cannot catch in time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many cities here, nesting inside this one. Maybe a million, probably more. When I wake up and feel like I’m falling, I walk the city. I look up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday with my feet I will swim into another New York that has forgotten the black in your eyes that day. There must be at least one. </p>
