					p Hello
					p Welcome to the L Train Notwork brought to you by the creative collective WeMakeCoolSh.it. We make projects for Art and Commerce.
					p We thought the subway would be more interesting with a mobile pirate WiFi intranet (a Notwork), so we made one. On our Notwork you will find a live chat room/dating site, curated content from local authors, poets, and visual artists, news feeds from popular sites, and a few other surprises. 
					p Just to be clear THIS IS NOT THE REAL INTERNET so you won't be able to check your email or browse the web.
					p The MTA is already hard at work with their plans to provide true internet access. In the meantime, please enjoy our little Notwork. 
					p If you have any questions or comments you can reach us at: <a href="mailto:subway@wemakecoolsh.it">subway@wemakecoolsh.it</a>
					div Sincerely
